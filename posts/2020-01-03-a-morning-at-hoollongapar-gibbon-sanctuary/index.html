         <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Our trip to Hollong was one of the most challenging and memorable ones.
Still, after so many months, it remains clear like yesterday. We slept
early knowing we have to leave early. So when the alarm went off at 4 AM
the whole place was quiet and dark. We hauled all our luggage from the
room to the rented car. It was a bit of a task given that we were
staying backside of the property. Any way by 4:30 we started and headed
east to Hollongapar GIBBON.</p>
<p>The traffic was thin as there was not much movement in the early
morning. Soon the sun came out, but the road condition started to
deteriorate with ongoing road widening and other work. We passed many
tea gardens on both sides of the national highway. But suddenly we saw
one accident and lots of people. As we approach slowly we saw the
accident involved a truck carrying fresh fish and another vehicle. As
the fishes would spoil every villager was carrying two-three big fishes
in their hand or any makeshift begs that they could find. It was quite a
scene. I am sure those villagers even might remember that day when they
had a Fete ðŸ˜ŠÂ </p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Soon we crossed Jorhat and saw the
sign for Mazuli (our later destination). We were following Google Maps
and soon we were in the middle of a tea garden as we left the highway
behind. We were a little puzzled as there was no mention of crossing a
tea garden when we discussed the road condition previous night with Wild
Grass Manager. As we had no choice we continued driving and soon we
reached a spot where there was a small signboard which said
Hollong.Â <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->  
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>But by now the road condition is just dirt track and with previous night
rain, it was only suitable for a 4x4. Our rental car was the cheapest
one a small Ford Figo. There was no place to take u-turn as the road was
narrow and we were moving forward at a snail pace using the tire marks
from other cars. We saw only 3 people on this road who were on bicycles
collecting fallen woods from the forest. With my broken Assamese, I just
managed to ask where is Hollong/Gibbon and they just showed with their
hand go forward. Aarush was sleeping in the back seat and we were scared
as there was no mobile signal and we realized we are middle of the
jungle. After driving for quite a few KMs we reached a spot where we saw
forest personal.Â </p>
<p>They gave us a strange look as we were not the locals and had no local
guides with us and how we reached there from the wrong road. Talking to
them it became clear (<em>thanks to Google Maps)</em> we drove through the
jungle which is not at all sensible as there are wild elephants who are
active in the early morning.Â </p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The forest personnel asked us to pay a minimal fee and told one guard
will come with us and it is a walking tour. This was our first walking
tour inside a forest where there are wild animals like elephants and
leopard. Luckily we got some company of another tourist who came with
Diganta Gogoi. Mr. Gogoi runs a homestay and the best guide for Hollong
and surrounding areas. Now there are two guards allocated for 6 of us,
and they were carrying very old guns on their shoulders. The purpose of
those guns maybe just to scare away any animals. I thought we will just
go inside for a few hundred meters and come back. And after the scary
drive was bit disoriented so when Aarush asked which shoes to put I said
just put crocs. But he somehow decided to put proper shoes.Â </p>
<p>As soon as I entered I saw a bright bird and clicked it. And to my
surprise, it was <strong>Red Trogon</strong> and soon the trogon flew away without
giving any chance of a second shot. There are only <strong>three</strong> types of
<strong>trogon</strong> in <strong>India</strong>, two are found in North East <strong>Red-Headed</strong> and
<strong>Ward</strong> Trogon. And <strong>Malabar</strong> Trogon in the Western Ghats.Â </p>
<p>Soon we started to spot the primates we saw <strong>Gibbon, Pig-tailed
Macaque, Stump-tailed Macaque</strong>. Other primates found in the same forest
are *<strong>Capped Langur, Assamese Macaque, Rhesus Macaque</strong> and the only
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->nocturnal primate<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the north-east, the
**Bengal Slow Loris.Â ***</p>

group of Stump-Tailed Macaque crossed just in front of us, but my bad
luck I ran out of battery. And in the morning with all excitement from
the crazy driving, I completely forgot to put the spare battery in my
pocket. Asrush got 4 leech bites but he was brave enough not to make any
noise.Â </p>
<p>After a few hours of jungle safari on our foot, we turned back to the
car. We had a quick chat with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thegibbontravels/">Mr.
Gogoi</a> and he invited us to
stay next time in his homestay which we are looking forward,Â </p>
<p>And this time with proper direction from the forest guide took the road
to Jorhat our next destination.</p>
