It was a different protocol
each time. Today I am lost in a mysterious maze of chasing thoughts;
want to pin them down and seal them in jars before they disappear
leaving behind nothing but an empty spot. I came to Tata Sherwood when
my son was 5 months old and today he is almost 3 yrs old. In this time
span I met so many people. I had a great time here. With few I was
really close and with rest others I shared so much so that we have
amicable relationship to talk on any topic without restricting myself to
any specific age group or any particular culture.</p><p>I remember when we moved to this apartment Santanu said while strolling
in the pavement one evening you are not social person you need to reach
out to people rather sitting at home. And now he says you better stay
here with your friends; me-Aarush will move to Hebbal. As with blatant
nostalgia and sentimental heated arguments along with lots of ifs and
buts I was given option of selling this property but to which I didn&rsquo;t
agree with the thought that some day maybe it will get appraisal. It is
said &ldquo;home is where the heart is&rdquo; and for me my heart is at Sherwood
still with my friends I made in these bygone years.</p><p>It took me long to make up my mind finally for the move. Strange
right&mldr;to hear this where people don&rsquo;t want to move to their own
apartment. Well,You heard it right. Here,medium of meeting people was
through Aarush. At times I use to arrange small snack party or pot-luck
or dinner&mldr;.I won&rsquo;t say party rather get-together. It was more of an
attempt to meet working -non working mothers. Every time there was
addition of 1 or 2 new face. Although at times there were friends with
whom views didn&rsquo;t match in certain topics but still we kept meeting each
other. I learnt a lot at same time subconsciously or otherwise about
human behavior etc.</p><p>In turn I can&rsquo;t say whether it was burden to them or not but they also
use to invite me be at religious purpose like haldi-kumkum or may be
similar evening snacks party. One of the major get together use to be
birthday parties of kids. Almost every month we had at least one party.
This parties gave opportunity to kids to wait for their return gift even
before giving the birthday gift as well cake cutting with lots of enthu.</p><p>Well, at end I love the irony of my combined housewarming and my move
get -together with friends in 2-3 sets where I gave them token of my
remembrance to every one I knew and meeting them for one last time while
staying in that same community. As it was not possible for me to go to
each and everyones place for dinner or lunch.</p><p>My sincere special thanks to Kalpana, Kanchan, Pragati, Harshu and Anita
lastly but not least Neeti who despite of their busy schedule arranged
an awesome dinner. Nevertheless to all my known acquaintances I will
never forget you and keep coming to Sherwood whether you guys come to
visit me in my new place or not.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2010-11-19-shekhawati-open-air-art-gallery/ title="Shekhawati - Open Air Art Gallery"><span class="icon is-small"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left"></i></span><span>Previous</span></a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2011-02-01-jaipur/ title=Jaipur><span>Next</span>
