<a href=https://santm.com/tags/aarush/>Aarush</a><h4>April 15, 2009</h4></div></div></section><section class="section blog"><div class=container><div class="columns is-mobile"><div class=column><div class="content blog-post section has-text-justified" itemprop=articleBody><br><p><strong>(17th March-16th April)</strong></p><p>Now, Aarush started to twitch, smile, frown and stretch a lot after
waking from sleep. Amazingly ( I never knew this) and apparently babies
between three to four months are at the stage where they get very
playful and drinking milk is not a priority anymore, I believe. They
prefer to talk and coo to adults, and being very observant at this stage
and they are attracted to moving objects, colours and everything new
around them. So was our little one.</p><p>It was not even month stay at Durg, on april 8th Santanu came to meet
Aarush for 3-4 days. Before leaving from Mumbai Santanu warned me not to
pamper him much by taking him in arms all time but later I found&mldr; on
hearing one shrill cry he use to run to him.</p><p>Aarush now started cooing in response to gentle, soothing words of his
didu. Keeps his fist in his mouth most of the time and drools sometimes.
Enjoy holding his toys for a short period of time. Turns head towards
sounds. Rattles, bright pictures use to attract him. His Mesho (maternal
uncle) came to meet him unexpectedly. Now he started liking to be held
upright.</p><p>By now he can lift up his head and hold it up quite steadily for quite a
while. He smiles when we tickle or touch his cheeks, and his cooing just
melts our hearts away! He captures the hearts of every people who come
to meet him. Now lots of visitors come to meet him.</p><p><a href=../images/2009-04-15-third-month-aarush-3rddmonth.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2009-04-15-third-month-aarush-3rddmonth.jpg alt></a></p><p>Sometimes he use to blow bubbles a lot. Nanu and didu were very happy
with his stay at their place. Every morning nanu use to spend quality
time with him. Every hour or so his nanu use to come to see and talk to
him. My dad is not at all trained with baby care but then also use to
carry him with nervous hands and Aarush never use to do any mischief
with him. Thrice he put his grandson to sleep when I and my mom were
busy in work. So, were the days at our end.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2009-04-14-wayanad-iii/ title=Wayanad-III><span class="icon is-small"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left"></i></span><span>Previous</span></a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2009-04-22-fourth-month/ title="Fourth month"><span>Next</span>
