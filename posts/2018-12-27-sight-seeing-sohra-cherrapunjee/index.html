after a good breakfast and settling our bills we left towards
Cherrpunjee. The sky was cloudy but not raining. The 16KM drive is a
long one from the resort we stayed and the road of last 8 KM was really
bad. </p><p>We started with <strong>Thangkharang Park</strong> which looked farthest on the map.
The road was good for the most part but again the last 4/5 KM was under
heavy construction. Our legs were heavy from yesterday’s hike still we
walked around the whole park. We got to see <strong>Kynrem falls</strong> from there.
And Bangladesh plain was in plain sight. The water was not so heavy in
Kynrem falls as we were just before the monsoon. I am sure in monsoon
the sight will be completely different with roaring water rushing down
the hill.  The waterfall is made of three or four stages as you can see
from the picture. We could see one or two cars on the winding road and
there were a few tourists we went to the base of the falls.</p><p>From the park, we headed towards <strong>Pillar Rock/Khoh Ramhah</strong> but there
was no other soul out there. There was no board explaining what we
really need to see. So we felt a little disappointed and just circle
back from there.</p><p>On the way back to Sohra we first went to <strong>Mawsmai Cave</strong>, this is a
small cave compared to our very own Belum Caves in Andhra Pradesh. But
as usual, the cave had its own fun. Some passages were really small and
narrow. And you need to be mindful of your steps all the time as there
was water. We were followed by a big Bengali group and they were very
noisy which really spoiled the fun. Being a Bengali, we really feel
ashamed by these large noisy tourists at times. Anyway as we came out
and was looking for some biscuits and snacks from the back the car we
realized we left our shoe bag at the resort.</p><p>We called the resort and they informed yes it was left just out of our
door and they have kept it safe. After a quick stop at the <strong>Monoliths</strong>
which are on the road itself, we headed back to resort again. We did not
stop at Eco-Park and the viewpoint. The drive of 16KM back and forth
with the broken and twisted road cost us an hour plus.</p><p>After picking up the shoe bag we headed towards <strong>Nohkalikai
Waterfalls</strong>. The road is splendid, we stopped many times, we tried the
most difficult form of photography aka landscape with little success.
There were lots of spices, pickles and local handicrafts being sold at
the viewpoint. </p><p>After Nohkalikai falls we headed back to the Sohra again and stopped at
<strong>Ram Krishna Mission</strong>.  This is very close to the ground where my
Shillong-Cherrapunji Marathon ended 2+ years back. This RK Mission
played a big role in Meghalaya’s modern history. There is a museum on
the first floor highlighting Meghalaya and NorthEast as a whole.</p><p>After RK mission we decided to head back to GHY post lunch. We stopped
at the “<em><strong>Orange Roots</strong></em>” a vegetarian restaurant on the highway very
crowded.   The food was fresh and hot and it was clean.</p><p>As we approached Shillong we thought of visiting <strong>Shillong Peak</strong> and
drove all the way to the Air Force base to get the ticket when we
realized we missed the cutoff. Disappointed we headed back to the
highway. The road was narrow and had to manage big construction trucks
on the turns and twist which was a complete waste. And top of that the
weather was perfect with late afternoon sun on a clear blue sky ☹</p><p>We spoke with our hotel owner in Kaziranga and he was saying if you
really want ride a little longer from GHY and next 4/5 hours you will be
there. While it sounded promising we were not ready for that long drive.
Alternately he suggested stopping near GHY where there are lots of new
resorts. We found it was way cheaper to book via <em>MakeMyTrip</em> so we
booked online and headed toward GHY. We were going to stay at
<strong>Brahmaputra Jungle Resort</strong>. Lucky for us we did not face major
traffic while getting out of Shillong it was snail pace but moving. It
did take a long time to get out from one end to the other of Shillong,
We could see the long queue of cars/bus/trucks getting towards
Shillong.  </p><p>We did stop for few minutes at **Badapani/ Umiam **Lake but no great
sunsets.  This time we are cautious and did not miss on “<strong>JAVA VEG</strong>”
for our break. We had a good break there and almost had our early dinner
and headed towards our night stop.</p><p>By the time we reached the resort we were really tired after so many
tourist places and driving. After we finished taking a hot shower and
all it started to rain. And it did rain like cats and dogs for a long
time. We were lucky that we did not need any room service as there was
no chance for those hotel guys to serve us in the rain. And this place
is a resort the place we were staying and the dining area was quite
far.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2018-12-17-tiring-yet-happy-day-double-decker-root-bridge/ title="Tiring yet happy day - Double Decker Root Bridge"><span class="icon is-small"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left"></i></span><span>Previous</span></a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2019-02-20-day-1-in-kaziranga-april-2018/ title="Day 1 in Kaziranga - April 2018"><span>Next</span>
