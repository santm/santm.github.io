to go back to snow clad beauty of Switzerland instead of its
Mediterranean lake shores. But before having a heavy breakfast, we took
a promenade in the park along lake shore where there are lots of open
sculptors from <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada title="Dada Movement">Dada
movement</a>. After we
took funicular ride to Madonna del Sasso.</p><p>We were determined to take glacier express from Andermatt to St.Moritz
today. So, by 9.00 we reached station; Santanu saw a BBC program about
Wilhelm Express on TV and was eager to board the same from Locarno till
it connects Glacier Express. But due to train schedules we had to take
an inter-regional train from Locarno to Goschenen via Bellinzona. Our
compartment was vacant with two of us only. That left us to hop from one
side to another in order to take photos as the train made turns to gain
altitude. Being a standard train the chief advantage is the windows
generally can be opened, for cool air and unobstructed views and take
picture – with <em>no ghost image.</em></p><ul><li></li></ul><p>*</p><p>On reaching Goschenen we immediately boarded another train to Andermatt
where we spent an hour taking photos. Swiss trains are like Swiss
watches never late-always on time so was Glacier Express</p><p><a href=../images/2006-07-16-glacier-express-20th-june-glacier.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2006-07-16-glacier-express-20th-june-glacier.jpg alt></a></p><p>This train actually starts from St.Moritz to Zermatt or vice versa which
is of 7 1/2 hr. journey across 291 bridges, through 91 tunnels and
across the Oberalp Pass at 2033 m altitude. It’s really incredible
journey via beautiful landscapes with valleys, glistening mountains &
splendid greenery. It’s a train with huge wrap-around windows, allowing
you to see through part of the ceiling no wonder why visitor do not
complain spending bucks. You never know how alpine panoramas hits right
in the face unless you experience it. But, the windows in the panoramic
cars generally can&rsquo;t be opened, means <em>photographs usually come with a
glare.</em></p><ul><li></li></ul><p>*</p><p>As soon as we boarded the train, memories from Bollywood movies got
refreshed. As there are umpteen of songs featured on this train.
Unfortunately, we did not have window seats. And as it was mid-day lots
of people were having their lunch at their seat. The dining car was next
compartment to ours; we spent a good time there. Glacier express is a
very touristy train as people from every corner of the world try to
taste Swiss Alpine beauty. We had good conversation with our
co-passengers who were Americans staying at Saudi Arabia.</p><p>On reaching St.Moritz we had a nice meal freshly prepared at Railway
restaurant. As staying in the classic alpine resort was out of our
budget so it was more economical to board a train for final destination
to Zurich via Chur.</p><p>The train back from St-Moritz was a normal one which was good as that
allowed us to take pictures with out glare. The journey from Chur to
Zurich was also very scenic as the train runs along two lakes - Lake
Walen and Lake Zurich.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2006-07-15-rescued-19th-june/ title="Rescued - 19th June"><span class="icon is-small"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left"></i></span><span>Previous</span></a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2006-07-16-mount-titlis-21st-june/ title="Mount Titlis - 21st June"><span>Next</span>
