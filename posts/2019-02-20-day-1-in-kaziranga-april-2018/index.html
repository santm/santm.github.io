<a href=https://santm.com/tags/kaziranga/>Kaziranga</a><h4>February 20, 2019</h4></div></div></section><section class="section blog"><div class=container><div class="columns is-mobile"><div class=column><div class="content blog-post section has-text-justified" itemprop=articleBody><br><p>After a good night sleep with thunders and rain, the morning was clear
of rain but the sky had overcast. Without much delay, we put all our
stuff in the car and head out of the resort for Kaziranga. The best
thing about the resort for us its proximity to the highway. We drive on
the straight highway going east. The road was divided four lanes and
there was not much traffic and was cruising around 100KM/Hr.  We crossed
Pobitora wildlife sanctuary just outside Guwahati.</p><p>We even kept a half day back up to visit Pobitora if we do not get to
see much in Kaziranga. We were getting hungry as last night the dinner
was quite early and did not even had tea/coffee before leaving the
resort.  As we look out for a decent place to stop for breakfast we
reached Anuraag Dhaba near Nagaon bypass.</p><p>We ordered two plates of breakfast. The dish was served in an authentic
Bronze plate with lots of different vegetables.  The staffs were wearing
traditional Assamese Mekhela Chadar. We were quite impressed with the
food and service. The food was served in a very satisfactory manner and
the taste was splendid. Overall, we really had a &ldquo;something special&rdquo;
kind of experience. Please do not keep your hope too high after all it
is a simple place to eat on a highway, but would recommend it for sure.</p><p>Now, as soon as we crossed Nagaon the road condition deteriorated. There
was work going on to make four lanes which we are back to 2 lanes road
and have to navigate traffic with caution. As we left GHY early we had
plenty of time in our hand for the afternoon safari which we had
planned. </p><p>Now we had to cross the Western and Central Zone gate of Kaziranga
before reaching our destination “<strong>Wild Grass</strong>”.  As we approach the
turn to be taken as suggested by Google map I find a small road going
inside from the highway. I did not take that road as there was no sign
or anything for Wild Grass. After going 100 meters or so I ask someone
local and he points back to the same road. So reluctantly I took the
road which is a narrow road with stones and you see bamboo houses, some
small plantation and drive like that for a 1KM.  We continue and at
last, there is a sign for “Wild Grass” a small one on the fork.  But as
we approach the property we just get mesmerized. It is an old colonial
style big bungalow. </p><p>We were greeted by a warm welcome and were told we have good 2/3 hours
before the safari so we can just linger around have lunch and then head
out for afternoon safari.</p><p>The lunch was an authentic Assamese one   </p><p>This place is unique and the owner is the best. He was instrumental in
planning this trip. He shared so many details about Kaziranga that no
guidebook could have covered it better.</p><p>Soon we started for our first safari to the <strong>West Zone,</strong> in fact, we
have crossed this gate while coming from Guwahati. It is almost 20/25
minutes drive Wild Grass. Once we reached the gate we had to buy tickets
and pay the camera fee and all.</p><p>We were fortunate enough to spot the one-horned rhino. We spotted
elephants and spotted deers. There were many birds but as a beginner, we
were not very well versed with the same. We saw an Indian Roller from a
close distance. Spotted Pallas Fish Eagle, Lesser Adjutant, Ruddy
Shelduck, Pied Kingfisher, and others.</p><p>Kaziranga has very tall grass so animal sighting is mainly near the edge
of wetlands and in short grass areas. Technically Swamp Deer is more
endangered than the Asian one-horned rhino as far as the world
population is concerned.</p><p>We headed back to the resort as the sun sets in the east, the hotel had
warm snacks and tea. And once again the dinner was fabulous.</p><p>We felt like we accomplished all we had to do in Kaziranga ;) but
honestly, as I write this post after so many months I find myself
reliving each moment once again and wish we could have stayed there for
long.</p><h3 id=descriptionkaziranga-has-very-tall-grass-so-animal-sighting-is-mainly-near-the-edge-of-wetlands-and-in-short-grass-areas>DescriptionKaziranga has very tall grass so animal sighting is mainly near the edge of wetlands and in short grass areas.</h3></div></div></div></div></section></div><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2018-12-27-sight-seeing-sohra-cherrapunjee/ title="Sight Seeing Sohra (Cherrapunjee)"><span class="icon is-small"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left"></i></span><span>Previous</span></a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2020-01-03-kaziranga-information-you-need-to-know-before-visiting/ title="Kaziranga  - information you need to know before visiting"><span>Next</span>
