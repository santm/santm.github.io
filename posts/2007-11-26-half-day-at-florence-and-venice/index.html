We
packed and checked out, keeping our luggage in the hotel. We walked
towards <strong>Palazzo Vecchio</strong> (Piazza della Signoria) - city square
adorned with fine arts. Basically, Florence is full of timeless beauty
which can keep you captivated. Close to this square is <strong>Uffizi</strong> which
we reached by 8:30 AM for our visit. Uffizi’s structure is like a long
rectangle; it is not very big in structure like other top European
museums. Famous paintings by <em>Leonardo, Dante, Michelangelo & Boticelli</em>
are a sight not to be missed; a true Mecca for art lovers.</p><p>Around mid-day we were back to hotel; picked our luggage and headed to
train station for next destination – <strong>Venice</strong>. Venice is only three
hours away from Florence by train. An unusual city built on small
islands and traversed by some <em>100 criss-cross canals</em>.</p><p>Reaching Venice first thing we bought 2 day-pass for Public Transport.
Don’t be surprise the only way to transit in this man made city is by
<strong>boat or water-taxi</strong>. We stayed at <strong>Lido</strong> across sea and there are
plenty of ferries connecting St. Marco Square and Lido. On reaching
hotel, to my surprise for the first time someone knew my birthplace as
mentioned in passport. The manager on duty was a Bangladeshi who took
refuge in my home town during 1974 war. He is been leaving in this
romantic capital for a long time. After a while we departed immediately
towards <strong>St. Mark’s Square</strong> which is quite lively with tourists
enjoying drinks and duel orchestra. It’s the place where you can notice
increase in level of tide water which shows sign of sinking Venice.</p><p>Venice is the place where one can get lost in endless mazes of
backstreets, deserted squares and mysterious alleyways leading off from
the city. We walked carelessly around there and explored few narrow
lanes near by.</p><p><strong>Cost of dinner in the city of romance is very expensive</strong> if you are
looking for fresh local sea-food. We opted for a crowded simple
pizzeria. Taste of the pizza was awful; disgusted with same as we were
discussing between ourselves when a mother and her teenage daughter
joined from next table. They were from New Zealand on their winter
vacation. It was a nice and long conversation with them as they were
supposed to go to Florence from Venice.</p><p>We took some night mode picture of empty St. Marco square with our new
tripod before returning to Lido.</p><blockquote><p>With all said and done I found Venice like a big Disney land. There
are only two kinds of people; either tourist or related to tourism.
May be there is a vibrant and young Venice somewhere which we missed
to figure out. In Rome, Milan or Florence we never had the same
experience as there we saw local young people going to school or
college or just hanging out in one of the piazza.</p></blockquote></div></div></div></div></section></div><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2007-11-25-siena/ title=Siena><span class="icon is-small"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left"></i></span><span>Previous</span></a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2007-11-27-venice-at-leisure/ title="Venice at leisure"><span>Next</span>
