Packed everything night before so that
after breakfast we can check-out without much wasting of time.It was
holiday at Singapore as of some Muslim festival. My plan was to go to
<strong>Arab Street</strong>. This area has beautiful old shop houses that line the
streets. </p><p><a href=../images/2010-04-19-thursday-arab-street-IMG_4703.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2010-04-19-thursday-arab-street-IMG_4703.jpg alt></a></p><p>The highlight of the area is the grand <strong>Sultan Mosque</strong>, which was
crowded as people were coming out after prayers.I think Arab Street is
known for the <em><strong>fabrics</strong></em> a great place to go if you want or need cut
piece. Here you can find materials of every imaginable colors. Not only
fabric but also carpet, prayer mats, jewelries oriental carpets,
pashminas, sarong, batik shirts etc. I think you can BARGAIN!!!! but not
sure. The shops here sell French Lace, Thai silk, Brocade, Indian Silk
buttons, and many more&mldr;anything related to sewing.</p><p><a href=../images/2010-04-19-thursday-arab-street-IMG_4701.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2010-04-19-thursday-arab-street-IMG_4701.jpg alt></a></p><p>It is a great stop to just walk around and see the shop house
architecture of Singapore. Seemingly <em>endless number of fabric shops</em>
starts to make your head spin. On Baghdad street-there are a lot of new
restaurants/cafe houses. Many of the restaurants have sheeshas or water
pipes, which you can smoke while having sip of coffee. We had <strong>kasha
laham</strong> for lunch at <em>Cafe le Caire @ Al Majlis</em> located at 39 Arab
Street which was for more than 2 person in terms of portion.</p><p><a href=../images/2010-04-19-thursday-arab-street-IMG_4716.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2010-04-19-thursday-arab-street-IMG_4716.jpg alt></a>After
having heavy lunch we walked towards <strong>Bugis street</strong> but I missed the
charm of it as Santanu was not in mood for any more shopping. Its place
for shop-alcoholics with good street shopping experience. </p><p><a href=../images/2010-04-19-thursday-arab-street-IMG_4732.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2010-04-19-thursday-arab-street-IMG_4732.jpg alt></a></p><p>Then came to <strong>Raffles hotel</strong> to see its colonial style architecture.
It houses museum shops, tropical garden courtyard and Victorian-style
theater, tiffin room among many others. Best part is at raffles you will
be first welcomed by a <em>Sikh doorman</em> dressed in white ironed Grieves
and Hawks uniforms with thick mustache as you get down from your car. It
is impossible to overlook the doorman dressed in traditional Sikh
attire. But what is fascinating is the fact that they are one of the
most photographed icons of Singapore.</p><p><a href=../images/2010-04-19-thursday-arab-street-IMG_4721.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2010-04-19-thursday-arab-street-IMG_4721.jpg alt></a></p><p>Then visited raffles mall and after strolling for a while decided to
return to our mandarin hotel as Santanu'&lsquo;s flight was ahead of us.
Yes&mldr;you heard it right..we had different flight on way back as well.</p><p>While going from here to Singapore it was smooth journey with Aarush but
on way back it was really terrible as flight was fully packed and with
time difference and whole day moving around he was cranky enough. With
very less leg space he was not getting proper sleep. Then after landing
too we have to spend another 2 hrs. at airport as Santanu had phone call
meeting.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2010-04-03-wedneday-visit-to-china-town/ title="Wedneday- Visit to China town"><span class="icon is-small"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left"></i></span><span>Previous</span></a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2010-04-23-ikea-made-in-india/ title="IKEA - made in India"><span>Next</span>
