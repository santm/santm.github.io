<a href=http://www.team-bhp.com/web/>Team-BHP</a> web site, specifically their
forum. And from then on is kind of hooked though not a car freak myself
with limited understanding for these electro-mechanical wonders. What
fascinates me is travelogue section of this forum. It is great to find
so many passionate souls sharing their trips and tricks. Last November
got an unexpected mail about a meet-up @ Yelagiri for Bangalore
team-bhpean; was not sure to join or not. Too much of work at the office
made it very difficult to commit.</p><p>On that special day somehow we started early @ 6:30 from home. Little -A
was sleeping when we started and there was thick fog when we reached
Dakshin Honda on Hosur Road. We saw many cars with BHP bumper sticker
waiting on the side of the road. Soon we crossed Karnataka border and
reached the town of Hosur. The road condition changed. Suddenly all
pot-holes were gone and driving becomes really cool. Definitely,
politicians and bureaucrats of Karnataka need to learn something from
their neighbor.</p><p>We stopped at A2B for breakfast, around 70 KM from Silk Board Junction
with Petrol Pump next to it which you can&rsquo;t miss it. There was lots of
crowds; it took us a while to get a decent place to sit and much longer
to get our idli-sambar. We left for Yelagiri Hills and soon left NH7 for
NH46 after first toll booth. There are signs for Chennai which you need
to follow; continuing on NH7 will take you to Salem. So after driving
another 50 KM, we crossed another toll booth from where we left NH46 for
Yelagiri. This state road was not that great but OK. The last 14 KM is
on the hilly section with hairpin turns. As we were quite early; not
much traffic before or behind us. Plenty of monkeys along the road, they
target cars for easy food if you are not careful.</p><p>We reached Yelagiri lake around 10-ish. Took a full round of the lake.
With Aarush we had no plan for hiking and boating so decided for lunch.
It was around 11:30 when we reached the Hotel Hills. The hotel was not
ready for lunch yet and Aarush had his lunch at reception while watching
some Tamil songs at the big screen. He was too sleepy to finish his
lunch; we decided it might be a better idea to start for Bangalore while
he sleeps skipping our lunch.</p><p>According to Outlook 52 weekend from Bangalore a typical weekend at
Yelagiri would be &ndash;</p><blockquote><p>Good breakfast, a gentle walk, lots of rest followed by lunch more
rest another stroll in the evening then Dinner &ndash; lots more rest, A
blissful weekend.</p></blockquote><p>On the way back we stopped again at A2B for a very late lunch. After
crossing Hosur, entry to Bangalore was painful. There is a huge
construction site around Electronic city for the mega fly-over on NH-7.
We visited one of my college mate in Hmatesayout on the way back as we
reached Bangalore well before Sunset.</p><p><a href=http://www.yelagirihills.com/how_to_get.htm>How to get there</a> &ndash;
