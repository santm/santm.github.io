<a href=https://santm.com/tags/tata-nano/>tata nano</a><h4>September 23, 2011</h4></div></div></section><section class="section blog"><div class=container><div class="columns is-mobile"><div class=column><div class="content blog-post section has-text-justified" itemprop=articleBody><br><p>Beginning of this year sold our Indica and bought Swift-Dzire(ZDI) which
we found very practical and perfect for our Indian need. And we did not
thought of booking any new car in recent time. Suddenly things got
changed when Pamela started a new job in May. We were quite happy with
single car and personally opted for BIAS (Bangalore International
Airport - Volvo) as I commute from Hebbal to Old Airport read every day
around 20KM one way.</p><p>But with rains things started to change and at times had to spend hours
for bus and rain is something which I enjoy with a cup of tea on a
balcony not on road with umbrella. So we said why not a second car &mldr;</p><p>Looked around in the classifieds but nothing clicked. There were just
three cars in our list</p><ul><li> <strong>Nano</strong> - Pros Price Cons - no power steering and many more as
listed by others.</li><li> <strong>Alto</strong> - Pros A complete car compared to Nano Cons Price
difference almost 1.5 L to 1.8L different between different trims.</li><li> <strong>Reva</strong> - Pros Alternative fuel Cons - Long running cost with
Battery replacement, niche car in itself, Price is quite high 4.25L
with AC model.</li></ul><p>After doing test drive on Nano & Alto Pamela said she is OK for Alto but
for not for Nano (power steering).</p><p><a href=../images/2011-09-23-a-small-nano-but-long-wait-nano.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2011-09-23-a-small-nano-but-long-wait-nano.jpg alt></a></p><p>We dropped Reva along the path and did not did a test drive.</p><p>But after 10 days of deliberation I had a test drove Nano. Definitely it
is different compared all the cars I drove till date. Found I can manage
it in city traffic for few days in a week. Plan to drive this when I
know for sure I will be late; other sunny days can always take BIAS and
have a worry free commute.</p><p>Now why CX ??? -having AC in car was a must so the basic model was
dropped. Found LX for another 30K is too much. As we would not be
driving this car in extreme condition do not need fog lights and other
features. With current 20K discount on road price for CX is just 2 lakhs
which sounds right for me. Dealer promised to put sun film, mud guard
and floor mats as complimentary. Might need to change the seats from
vinyl to fabric after some time.</p><p>The paper work was quite easy. Never bought a car like this before. The
first car I bought in USA almost took 4 hours of marathon
negotiation.But the delivery was a sad episode after 4weeks of wait
finally got the Nano yesterday. The delivery dates from the dealer kept
on slipping which was a shame and last Sunday we even given them
cancellation request if they fail to deliver it early this week.  On
Monday they said they will deliver it.</p><p>P.S. I drove the car for last two days, the ODO reads only 82KM for now.
It is OK to drive but definitely does not feel like a complete car. The
picture is from Nano website the car comes without alloy wheels.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2011-08-31-munnar-in-monsoon/ title="Munnar in Monsoon"><span class="icon is-small"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left"></i></span><span>Previous</span></a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2012-02-24-rameshwaram/ title=Rameshwaram><span>Next</span>
