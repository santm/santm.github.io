The
nearest attraction is Montreaux, but that being so close to Lausanne we
were discussing to keep it for last day. After taking a hearty breakfast
we reached railway station. We asked at the information desk about the
Swiss travel pass and Post Bus.</p><p>Traveling with yellow Swiss post bus system is really breath taking
experience as they connect any place in Switzerland which can’t be
reached by train. As we had some print out from web sites but none were
close to Lausanne. One of the routes that attracted our attention was
Napoleon route from Saas Fee to Locarno. But the special tourist post
bus operates once a day most of the time and you need to make
reservation for the same.</p><p>After buying Swiss Flexi Pass from the Railway station, boarded a train
to Visp. The train journey to Visp was nice as it gave the taste of Alps
and its beautiful mountain ranges. The bus trip from Visp to Saas Fee
was magnificent. We initially wanted to get the Glacier express today
itself but being a special train we could not connect the same. So we
spent only 20 minutes at Saas Fee also called pearl of Alps. Saas Fee is
a very beautiful car-free resort nestling at foot of glaciers One local
young gentleman invited us to little Himalaya of Europe while getting
down from the bus. There we had our ‘take away’ lunch.</p><p>On our way back we continued till Brig by the same bus. From Brig we had
two choices – either by a train or bus. Train goes to our next
destination in the south of Switzerland via long tunnel while bus takes
a longer route through Simplon Pass to some remote village of Italy from
where we were to take a train after 2 hours to our today’s destination
(Locarno).</p><p><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/santm/11232504955/in/set-72157638400761053><img src=../images/2006-07-15-post-bus-19th-june-way-3.jpg alt></a></p><p>Well, Santanu insisted on later uncertain one as we would have reached
Locarno at 21:30 and we had no hotel booked for that night. No doubt the
journey along this pass was breathtaking almost 2005m above sea level.
As soon as we reached border station we were only 2 passengers left from
the bus and we were transferred to a mini van where we had only one
co-passenger. It was quite assuring that someone is going with us as it
was already 5:30 PM quite late for a place in absolute no-where. We were
told by our co-passenger in broken English and Italian that there will
be a bus in next 5 minutes, but that 5 become 25 and we three are
waiting for bus. There is no posted time table of the same. We started
to realize that we were in Italy from the very systematic and punctual
Switzerland. It was quandary that we were in. The last part of today’s journey to
Locarno was a very memorable one as we got rescued by two gentle Swiss.</p><p>In short, trip via road across the most beautiful Alpine passes with
spectacular views over the snow covered mountains, through narrow
winding valleys, lakes and picturesque villages is something amazing.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2006-07-12-cest-fou-part-ii/ title="C’est fou - part II !"><span class="icon is-small"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left"></i></span><span>Previous</span></a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2006-07-15-lausanne-18th-june/ title="Lausanne -18th June"><span>Next</span>
