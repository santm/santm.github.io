Well I know
I made a big statement but could not start in better sarcastic way. Hold
on, let me explain from my past to present. I was thinking abut this
topic for a while a now as I see so many newspapers under my nose while
going to work by local train in the morning. It is almost like I read
every other headline from three to five major publishing houses.</p><p>Newspaper means many things to so many people but for me it surely means
a starting of a new day with news from yesterday,today and tomorrow. A
cup of hot beverage in one hand and a newspaper in the other will be
best way to start my day.</p><p>I remember once the newspaper used to be very boring in black and white.
That time there was no mass “offset” printing for newspaper in India.
The printing was not very clear and it used to be thin with only 8 to 10
pages.</p><p>If that make you think I am old ;) I was hooked to newspaper quite
early. Then suddenly one morning came offset printing with half-tone
picture of famous events in rare occasions. I remember it lasted for few
years. Then suddenly we found ourselves with the color supplement for
the weekend. It was exciting to check on weekly basis those glossy
papers; some times we would save them to cover books :D</p><p>With time newspaper started to become heavier in weights and started to
loose focus from main news. The downhill journey started. The focus of
editors turned to advertisement to make news paper cheaper for making
more profit.</p><p>Like addicts we got used to read about all those cocktail parties in
front page and City Complements.</p><p>This turned a golden way for the newspaper publisher to print photos of
celebrities. All celebrities like to show off little or more depending
on their personalities. May be we can call it a golden hen for the
editors. Indian society being very hypocratic it was an easy way to
publish swimsuit photos of Ms. Anderson with out any one complaining.
Indian educated conservative middle class adores the same. The whole
news paper has become a tabloid. That way Ms Stone & Spears makes
exclusive headline.</p><p>May be with economy doing good everyone is having a feel-good-factor; no
one really wants to read real news about the global climate change or
war on Iraq - everyone is happy in their little world. People are also
bored with reading Indian politics the same story of corruption, vote
bank – religion or caste from our politicians.</p><p>It is all most free can you believe that you can get one full year
subscription for just Rupees 199(less than 4 Euros). That means less
then One Rupees a day where One rupee can not buy any thing in India
now.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2006-12-04-linen-anniversary/ title="Linen anniversary"><span class="icon is-small"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left"></i></span><span>Previous</span></a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2006-12-31-welcoming-2007/ title="Welcoming 2007"><span>Next</span>
