<a href=https://santm.com/tags/birthday/>birthday</a><h4>February 3, 2009</h4></div></div></section><section class="section blog"><div class=container><div class="columns is-mobile"><div class=column><div class="content blog-post section has-text-justified" itemprop=articleBody><br><p>As usual there is lots of gaps of posting. Last month was quite hectic
as we celebrated Aarush&rsquo;s first birthday</p><p>We started planning from December onwards. As our schedule now revolves
around his nap-time and whims we hardly get time for each other or to
discuss any matter itâ€™s just a lot more rare these days than it used to
be. So, gone are the days of last minute plan. Despite how he has
completely turned our lives upside down we wanted to celebrate his first
b&rsquo;day which I know he hardly will acknowledge at this age. Basically, it
was more of a party for parents get-together on completing one-year
milestone.</p><p>Initially,we wanted to have it in a restaurant with few friends and
family members. Thus, short-listed few places but nothing was getting
finalized.We didn&rsquo;t wanted dinner party as it could be more stressful
whole day for us as well Aarush might get cranky. We wanted him to be in
good spirits for the special day.Thinking on all this aspects, finally
we decided to have the party over lunch at our apartment club-house
where we just need to rent some chairs and tables for that that day and
that is all.</p><p>This was the first time we were organizing B&rsquo;day party we were not sure
about the logistical part. It took a while to come up with final plan
with inputs from veterans (in kids party).</p><p>We sent invitation to our guests through <strong>Evite</strong> in-order to get an
idea how many guests are coming but we must admit we have to call people
at the end except few. Most of Indian can not say &ldquo;NO&rdquo; so we have lots
of guests in &ldquo;undecided-mode&rdquo;. That added one extra effort where we had
to find out if they are coming or not from the &ldquo;context&rdquo; of conversation
as no-one is going to say &ldquo;NO&rdquo; over phone either. This was truly
difficult part of all as based on this number everything depends be it
food ordering or cake or return gifts.</p><p>The food was ordered from <strong>Golkonda Chimney</strong>, near Marathalli. We were
lucky to get hold of one <strong>event-manager</strong> who helped us in decorating
the place, getting music system, Bouncer, Caricaturist and Balloon
Modelling.</p><p>Didn&rsquo;t had any parents-child games as we didn&rsquo;t wanted to worry too much
about entertaining the adults, just made sure they have all been
introduced to one another and they chat and mingle on their own.</p><p>As we already had cake before from <strong>Cake Walk, Indira Nagar</strong> - we knew
about its quality. Without thinking much we ordered 4 kg <strong>Black
Current</strong> Cake from there after tasting a piece. Now all three of us got
our Birthday cakes from same bakery after moving to Bangalore.</p><p>Next tedious thing was to work out on return gift. We categorized kids
into 3 groups based on their age.We bought toys and books for around 25
kids. Though it was not easy to choose from so many varieties -
hopefully they liked it.</p><p><a href=../images/2009-02-03-joyeux-anniversaire-mon-petit-aarush1stbday.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2009-02-03-joyeux-anniversaire-mon-petit-aarush1stbday.jpg alt></a></p><p>On the d-day party went on smoothly- Aarush was friendly. He was not at
all cranky for a single moment seeing the crowd. We got some <a href=http://aarush.santm.com/gallery3/index.php/First-birthday>cute
pictures</a>
through professional photographer, the cake was fantastic. Only thing
was we forgot to blow the candle before cutting cake.</p><p>At last we were very satisfied with the party and hope the same from our
guests.</p><p>Will always remember this first party of my son.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2009-01-03-happy-new-year/ title="Happy New Year"><span class="icon is-small"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left"></i></span><span>Previous</span></a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2009-02-04-journey-to-motherhood/ title="Journey to Motherhood"><span>Next</span>
