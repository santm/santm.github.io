well project submission dates. On reaching home from class on Saturday I
was desperate to go out of Bangalore to get charged to combat the
upcoming gruelling weeks at work and personal front with study. I had no
clue where to go for a day and started to check my faithful websites and
zeroed on <a href=http://www.anitabora.com/blog/2007/07/03/all-in-a-days-work-2/>Lepakshi from Anita’s
site</a>.
While she made a detour and visted two other places on the way we just
opted for Lepakshi via <strong>NH-7</strong> as was not in mood for too much of
adventure.</p><p>After a sound sleep we woke-up at 8.15 AM; left home late around 10.10
AM, had breakfast in a south indian fast-food corner before hitting the
road. City traffic was not that bad on Sunday and further away it was
thinner. After leaving behind the international airport there was not
much of traffic at all and we really left the concrete jungle behind.</p><p>Soon we crossed Devanhalli (new destination of real-estate agents) and
road towards Nandi-hills. The road from Devanhalli to Chikballapur is
underconstruction which means sometime you get a proper highway or else
DIVERSIONS with lots of big HUMPS. Those humps are actually meant for
big vehicles like trucks and buses while I punished my little Indica
with one or two whom I failed to recognize at right time.</p><p>Chikballapur looked like is small town as we passed by without stopping.
From there the condition of the road improves except few patches where
it is undergoing big construction.</p><p>Soon we were greeted by a big sign board which read “<strong>Eenadu Pradesh
welcomes you</strong>”.</p><p><a href=../images/2009-03-03-drive-to-heritage-site-lepakshi-sunflower_AS.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2009-03-03-drive-to-heritage-site-lepakshi-sunflower_AS.jpg alt></a></p><p>Just after crossing the border we found <strong>RAXA Academy and AP Tourism
Restaurant</strong> on our left. Right there we took narrow left turn and drove
for another 15 KM for Lepakshi. It is a state road that goes to Hindupur
via Lepaskhi. The road is narrow as well its condition is not very
great. And as there is not much traffic we were able to drive in
comfortable speed as long as one is alert. There are few patches where
we found lush green paddy fields which soothes ones eye in scorching
heat. We stopped by to take some pictures with sun-flower plantation; it
looked like an end of season for them.</p><p><a href=../images/2009-03-03-drive-to-heritage-site-lepakshi-shiva_linga.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2009-03-03-drive-to-heritage-site-lepakshi-shiva_linga.jpg alt></a></p><p>Soon we were able to see the back of big monolithic bull <strong>(Nandi).</strong> We
reached temple in this heat around 1.40PM; and was relieved to be in
shade. The temple is built by sandstone in **Vijayanagar (Hampi)**style
of architecture. This is <strong>Veerabhadra temple</strong> where there is a big
<strong>Monolithic Shiva-Linga</strong>. According to Hindu mythology, this seated
Nandi (bull) outside is gate keeper of Siva and Parvati generally faces
the main shrine. Here, it looks at this Linga (due to human settlements
now the line of sight is obstructed). We went into detail tour of the
temple as well courtyard. We almost burnt our feet while taking tour of
outer enclosure.</p><p>The temple is divided into three parts - the Nritya (Ranga-Dance)
Mandapa, the Ardha (Worship) Mandapa and the Kalyana Mandapa with 38
carved unfinished monolithic pillars.The temple as a whole is built from
sandstone and there are signs of severe erosion. I wish the whole place
was more maintained and preserved for generation to come.</p><p><a href=../images/2009-03-03-drive-to-heritage-site-lepakshi-lepakshi.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2009-03-03-drive-to-heritage-site-lepakshi-lepakshi.jpg alt></a></p><p>Well, while going Aarush had a good nap but on the way back he was very
active and naughty - as a whole he was a good kid.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Odometer Reading</strong> 0KM – Home 10KM – MG Road 23KM – Hebbal 52KM –
