Seeing its
publicity <em><strong>Qatar Airways, one of the fastest growing airlines in the
world. Taking you more personally!</strong></em> every now & then on BBC encouraged
us to book for the same. This airline is based in Doha, Qatar covering
around 70 international destinations. Check-in at Paris was very smooth
though they were very strict about luggage weight.</p><p><a href=../images/2006-05-22-uddan-flight-doha-1.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2006-05-22-uddan-flight-doha-1.jpg alt></a></p><p>In-flight service was good with very comfortable seats having enough leg
room; quality of the food was better than what we had before and was
good with choice of films and music on demand. In short, good service
for almost 7-8hrs.of long haul flight. What let the airline down was
ground services at Doha airport which was awful. Too congested, with no
seats, toilets overloaded. There you can see all South-Asians in blue
collar jobs. Services at airport were very poorly managed.</p><p><a href=../images/2006-05-22-uddan-flight-doha-2.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2006-05-22-uddan-flight-doha-2.jpg alt></a></p><p>Qatar generously gave free dinner coupon for 4 hours stop-over in the
age of no-frill air lines. Finding a long queue and no place to seat we
opted for a quick stroll in the small duty free section. Having all
kinds of perfume from France, small souvenirs, wines, cigarettes and YES
last but not least is our <strong>yellow metal</strong> (gold) shop. Where every
Indian was making a pilgrimage. Truly, wherever & whatever the price of
gold be Indiaâ€™s fascination towards it will not lessen. We too went
<a href=http://www.frey-wille.com/>there</a> especially Pamela who is no less.</p><p>Now having watched <a href=http://syrianamovie.warnerbros.com/>Syriana</a> few
days before it looks as if few of its scenes were getting played there.
Arab men in there white dress and women in their black just 4 feet
behind them. And the same goes for those South-Asian working community
in middle east.</p><p><a href=../images/2006-05-22-uddan-flight-doha-3.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2006-05-22-uddan-flight-doha-3.jpg alt></a></p><p>It was time to board for our next flight from Doha to Delhi. Everyone
was in rush to get into the flight showing their so called Indian
etiquettes as if they have bought the flight; and flight was going to
leave without them. Again in-flight service was good along with food
menu. As the flight landed people from rear end seem to be in more hurry
then those who were sitting at front. Best part was the person from back
who came running to be the first to take exit from economy class was the
one who was asking for help at Immigration counter as he was not able to
fill it himself.</p><p>May God bless those Indians! Otherwise rest journey was peaceful.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2006-05-21-sikkim-gangtok/ title="Sikkim - Gangtok"><span class="icon is-small"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left"></i></span><span>Previous</span></a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2006-05-23-bike-route/ title="Bike Route"><span>Next</span>
