convention it is <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anniversary><strong>Linen
Anniversary</strong></a> we have still
have a long way to go before it will be any precious or strong material.</p><p>This day is special in another way as it is birthday of Prateek
(maternal cousin of mine). Now we stay above floor from Prateek. After
our wedding this is the first time that we three are together. But this
week Prateek is the man of his house as my Uncle and Aunt are out of
town. Now planning for going out for dinner became a complicated task as
we do not own a car yet. And I can not drive my Uncle’s car; without car
moving around Navi Mumbai is not convenient and particularly in late
evening or early night. We three settled for a scale down version agreed
to meet up at Vashi which is most crowed Hip-hop Township in Navi
Mumbai.</p><p>The day started in the usual way. After work at evening I took the train
back and got down at Vashi. Now I was bit early for the meeting with
Pamela and Prateek. They told me as soon they start in car they will
call me and asked me to hang out in the only big mall of Navi Mumbai
called &ldquo;<strong>CENTER ONE</strong>".</p><p>I was lucky to get a bench to sit in the mall and watch people to kill
time. Those 30 minutes was very long and boring in simple words. And I
never fancied waiting. But then watching people is all I could do ?.
Well this mall is a circular one with escalators in the middle and my
bench is at 2nd floor looking at the escalators.</p><p>Soon I watched something usual to myself; there is one dedicated person
next to the escalator to assist people. Yes there are people who need
assistance in getting to a moving staircase and thanks to mall
management and abandon man power of India for providing the same. It was
funny looking at those nervous faces as they put their steps on
escalator.</p><p>That reminded me of my mother who insisted in taken steps in place of
escalators in Paris last year. That time I fount it was very silly and
what is the big deal that she was mentioning about escalators. Now
looking at so many people needing assistance I found myself on the wrong
side for making fun of mom.</p><p>Well after waiting around half an hour the plan got changed as the
driver who was supposed to drive Pamela and Prateek did not showed up; I
have to catch train back to Kharghar. We had to settle for a vegetarian
restaurant within walking distance from our home well a VERY BIG
disappointed evening.</p><blockquote><p>P.S. Now as I try to complete this post after almost a month – the
evening is yet to come for going out for a good restaurant.</p></blockquote></div></div></section><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2006-11-28-local-trains-of-mumbai/ title="Local trains of Mumbai"><span class="icon is-small"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left"></i></span><span>Previous</span></a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2006-12-23-indian-newspapers/ title="Indian Newspapers"><span>Next</span>
