experience with 2014 Chennai Dream Runners Half marathon. After waiting
for weeks and getting constant update on social media that my friends
are being tagged in various albums I could not found a single picture of
myself what a pity when everyone was clicking with those super sharp
DSLRs and smart phones.</p><p>Like last year we travelled to Chennai in Shatabdi Express on Saturday
starting  early morning from Bangalore. The train journey was fun there
were many familiar faces along with few faces of our group. Some from
the last year opted out this year but at the end it was almost same
number of people. Had a good sleep on train this time and could not
participate in &lsquo;Gupshap&rsquo;. The journey to hotel this year was very smooth
compared to last year as we had a local Chennaite with us. We got down
from the bus right in front of our hotel in Adiyar.</p><p><a href=../images/2014-07-03-drhm-chennai-2014-IMG_20140621_130657%257E2.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2014-07-03-drhm-chennai-2014-IMG_20140621_130657%257E2.jpg alt></a></p><p>Had a big tasty south Indian veg-lunch at Sangeetha; the walk from the
hotel was little long as we got used to the hot & humid Chennai. I tried
my best to skip sleeping in the afternoon, evening we had long chat over
tea/coffee at Anand Bhavan about running and various upcoming events
like how and when we are going to participate on those. Suddenly it
started to  rain like cat and dog which was refreshing and brought down
the temperature little bit but shooted  humidity to higher level. Dinner
was a low key affair for us who opted to come back to Anand Bhavan. Some
of our friends had the dinner at hotel and was not so delighted with
their service.</p><p>There was the Iran Argentina group match for World Cup and I wanted to
watch it so I kept myself glued to the TV till half-time. A great
defense and tactical match from Iran where they blocked Argentina from
scoring anything till the last minute.</p><p>I got up around 3:45 as we were supposed to assemble at hotel lobby at
4:15 ; I had one banana, one Parx chocolate some dates and some water.
Remembering last year I tried to drink water previous day to hydrate my
body and kept my food simple. The moment came out of the AC room
realized this morning is going to be a tough one.  We jogged from hotel
to the start line which was around 1.6KM, by the time we reached the
starting pointed many of us were socked in sweat. Personally dressed
very light in a super thin sleeveless vest to keep myself cool.</p><p>Started the run with fellow runners from my running group and by the
time we crossed 2KM mark we were completley sweating. But the good part
the sky was dark and we were doing around 5 minute a KM for first 8 or 9
KM. In that course me & my running buddy crossed few others from our
running group who normally runs faster than us. It was a good and bad
sign - definitely I did not had a target , its either a sign of running
 fast now and having a  physical problem in the later part  or the
weather is playing its part and we are coping  better than others.</p><p>Around 9 KM when we were running along the beach my running buddy slowed
down a bit and I continued with the pace that I was comfortable and
stopped looking at GARMIN.  Around 18th KM meet with all the slow
runners / walkers from 10K race and had to navigate them as I passed.
Around 19th KM near Adiyar bridge found the local Chennaite from our
group running very strong and crossed me. That motivated me to follow
him and I kept reminding myself how a 2KM feels like in our practice
runs and tried to make my strides longer.  I did my best to finish
strong and gave my best in last 500 meters or so.</p><p>As I was relatively faster this time there was not so much queue for
post run breakfast I drank many cold bottle of water which were easily
available that time. My roommate did a wonderful run of 10K and cut-down
his previous best record by 4 min to complete the same in 42 minutes and
was celebrating the same. Called Pamela to let her know I was fine and
all went OK.</p><p>After 10/15 minutes or so when we as a group started to ensemble someone
reported one of from our group is having health issue and need medical
assistant. I went and was with him during the whole time he was
dehydrated and collapsed after finishing the race & while waiting in
breakfast queue. Any way he had a bad time with dehydration which caused
his BP to go down and needed drip. Oh! tell you when you are in medical
tent of a race you see the whole race and post-race celebration with a
different lens.</p><p>Met with LilyDi  and SameerDaa for lunch at their home, wow what a yummy
food it was with so many courses of fish.</p><p>As usual train ride back to Bangalore was less eventful and many had a
nap after a hard  race day.</p><p>I  did a personal best this time which I realized little late, for me
being able to run and enjoy the same was more important than the time.
But I think these few things really helped me in getting there.</p><ul><li><em>Train enough and train hard for race, as race has so many unknown.</em></li><li><em>Taper down your training .</em></li><li><em>Rest enough even it means watching TV or reading a book if you do
not get proper sleep in hotel bed.</em></li><li><em>Try your best to keep mind away from ‘target’, ‘pace’ and ‘timing’
just  enjoy the run as much as you can unless your are professional
runner.</em></li><li><em>Dress accordingly avoid experiment.</em></li><li><em>Hydrate enough but do not overdo it like I did last year where I
was barely running the last 5KMs. So I kept a water bottle with
myself 6KM onwards and had small gulp on regular intervals. But I
did not stopped in many water station as I like to have water when I
want.  Some cannot run with a bottle in their hand so it is better
to stop at water station and drink , find out what works for you.</em></li><li><em>Do not try to eat too much or too fancy on previous day.</em></li><li><em>If you have friends or relatives to meetup keep it post-race.</em></li></ul><p>And here are those 1000+ of pictures which I checked meticulously to
find myself in vain :(</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.808014375885248.1073741831.548956021791086&type=1"><em>https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.808014375885248.1073741831.548956021791086&type=1</em></a>
