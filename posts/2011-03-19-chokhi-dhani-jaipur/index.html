shopping. Had breakfast at hotel lawn for the first time. The buffet
breakfast at <strong>Hotel Madhuvan</strong> worth only when you have time to enjoy
it. We met one Indian family who were travelling from Gujrat for the
Diwali weekend to Jaipur and wanted to join us at Chokhi Dhani later in
the evening. Around 10 we left for shopping with Mr. Singh. Many shops
were closed on account of after Diwali mood but still we managed to hop
from one shop to another - Rajasthali, blue pottery shop etc. Then we
tried the famous <strong>Ram Chandra Kulfi</strong> (Indian Ice Cream) in Tripolia
Bazaar on way back to hotel for a siesta and left for Sanganer & Chokhi-
Dhani around 5ish.</p><p>We took Jaipur-Tonk Highway and did more shopping at <strong>Sanganer</strong> famous
for its block printing, screen printers, blue pottery and hand made
papers. According to Mr. Singh many store/small factories do not let
Indian inside as these stuffs are bit expensive for common Indian and
mostly for export.</p><p><strong>Choki Dhani</strong> basically gives picture of rural life of Rajasthan a
miniature theme park. Bit expensive but worth going for the dinner
alone. This resort is divided into two sections, one for daily visitors
while the other for overnight stays. The first section charges an
entrance (350 INR) fee that includes authentic veg Rajasthani dinner
with traditional floor seating arrangement and allows the visitors to
enjoy traditional rural activities such as tightrope walkers, camel cart
rides for minimal fees. There is also an A/C section for food which
charges around 700 INR.</p><p><strong>Ram Ram Sa!!!</strong> Was first thing to hear. First we had dinner there
which was wise decision as crowd was getting thicker with time.
According to the ticket schedule our dinner time was 10 PM; but as it
was around 8 there not much crowd and we got a seat quite easily. The
elaborate Rajasthani thali have many varieties of Chapaties (bread) and
vegetables which is served until you ask them to stop.</p><p>Took few rides to give Aarush exposure of all those village life;
different type of Rajasthani folk dance and songs were performed live.
The whole place is lighted with modern days lantern but as they are not
very bright you get a feeling of going back in time. Over all had nice
time and then we were back to hotel around 11.00pm</p><p>Next morning had flight back to Banglore in the morning. <strong>A
bientot</strong>!!!!</p></div></div></div></div></section></div><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2011-03-18-maro-des-rajasthan/ title="Maro des “Rajasthan”"><span class="icon is-small"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left"></i></span><span>Previous</span></a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/posts/2011-03-19-with-elephants-dubare/ title="With elephants @ Dubare"><span>Next</span>
