         <p>&ldquo;India is changing&rdquo; I am sure this is not a new topic to talk about. But
there are few things which got changed in India which my RADAR didn&rsquo;t
notice before. I am not going to debate on their pros and cons. Any
changes are more noticeable when we encounter the same old place or
person after a break. Like you meet up an old friend with whom you grew
up but that time probably you did not noticed he or she was growing
vertically and your mid- aged relatives were growing horizontally. But
you meet them after few years the changes become more noticeable to our
eyes.</p>
<p>This time, while passing in front of AIMS, Delhi I could not believe my
eyes the whole place changed for good the landscape is now full of
flyovers. Well, Delhi being the drawing room of India always gets
special attentions. I personally do not like flyovers, as they disfigure
the beauty. <strong>Parisian</strong> approach of building underpass is better to me.
But building those may be more costlier and without proper planning it
might be a nightmare after monsoon rain.</p>
<p>Thanks to Election Commission that writing is banned on the wall and it
had atleast kept our political parties away from the walls otherwise it
would have been full of &ldquo;hands&rdquo;, &ldquo;lotus&rdquo; and not to mention those
&ldquo;elephants&rdquo; ,&ldquo;hammer&rdquo; and what not. But those walls are now left with
poster from IIT coaching (<em>ISO certified)</em> to shoes.</p>
<p>I always need a haircut as soon I reach India and when I fly out of
India. One big benefit is the price but the primary motivation is the
quality of the haircut. So I went with SK to a nearest hairdresser. The
name of a normal haircutting saloons are not normal any more rather very
fashionable like <em>&ldquo;copper clips&rdquo;</em> or <em>&ldquo;silver scissors&rdquo;</em>. I should have
met guys who are coming up with innovative names before I registered
santm.com. A simple haircut which cost 15 rupees for my dad and he
thinks that is expensive the same costs to me Rs 60. But unfortunately
this place does not even have AC to call it a &ldquo;<em>Men&rsquo;s parlour</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>With all said and done the reason for typing so long was as I noticed a
19/21 years old boy quite FAT to my eyes was getting pedicure. Instead
of getting those pedicure and wasting his money he should have joined a
GYM or rather do some walking. I don&rsquo;t know how getting a pedicure is
making him better marketable. Well, it might be very personal view which
might not be shared by others as the first thing that you need is money
and it looked like he had a lot.</p>
<p>One thing I noticed in India for affluent class it means to be
overweight, having big tummy (men particularly) as they intake lot of
rich food, do less physical work and for every daily chores they have a
domestic helper. May be time has now come for educated Indians to
understand the values that comes with money and luxury.</p>
<p>Second thing is the number of mobile-phone users in the country is
experiencing a meteoric rise. Right from Sabjiwali (vegetable seller),
bai (helper), theleywala (cartpuller) to higher class is talking over
that small e-gadget for hrs&hellip;..God knows what topic they are talking
on.I think that day is not far when everyother person will be talking
over phone rather then in-person. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
