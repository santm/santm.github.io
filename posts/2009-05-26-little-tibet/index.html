         <p><em>(&hellip;.Continued)</em> Soon after leaving Brindhavan garden and on touching
the highway (SH88) road condition improved which looked like recently
renovated. Aarush was fast asleep after having his lunch which always
translates in smooth driving and I was able to drive at 80-90 KM. Along
the road crossed <strong>Bilikere, Husur &amp; Piriyapatna</strong> before reaching
<strong>Bylakuppe</strong>. It is an odd name which houses one of the largest Tibetan
settlement in India. We had to take a left turn from SH88 to go to the
monasteries. As soon as we took left turn we almost felt like driving in
North-East where you are greeted with Mongolian faces. There were bright
prayer flags along the road which symbolizes hope where as white ones
are for death.</p>

<p>This is really a bit of surreal - you are at middle of Karnataka, only
few hundred kilometers away from Bangalore and surrounded by thousands
of Buddhists monks and families. These people have left their home land
almost 40 years ago and new generation are born here only. Still they
keep their faith and tradition alive for generation to come. Like all
Tibetan settlements in India here also one requires <em>special permit</em> for
&ldquo;<strong>Non Indian(foreigner)</strong>&rdquo; to visit.</p>
<p>We went to <strong>Kagyu</strong> monastery first. This one sits on a hill top from
where you can see “Nalanda Institute” and other monasteries. The largest
of these 4 monasteries is <strong>Namdroling</strong> or commonly known as “Golden
Temple”. That day sky was in perfect blue and shrine with bright colors
were looking magnificent. Unfortunately, we ran out of battery(camera)
inside Namdroling. Aarush was bit startled with humming sound and to see
monks playing big drums.</p>

<p>For facts lovers the original name of Namdroling was <em><strong>&ldquo;Thegchog
Namdrol Shedrub Dargyeling&rdquo;</strong></em> luckily his Holiness Dalai Lama shorten
the name during his visit. Around 5000 monks are today studying there.</p>

<p>There is a big shopping area with lots of souvenir shops, ATM and
restaurant. Lots of magnificent stone show pieces were available which
were expensive for my budget. After having a very late lunch - <strong>momo</strong>
(it was not that great we get better momos at Siliguri - my home town)
we started for our homestay which was still hours away.</p>

<p>After Kushalnagar the road condition was not that good as lots of work
is going on to widen the road. Only mobile network which really works on
mountain road is of BSNL; both of our phones with private networks put
us on thought how to locate our home-stay. We entered an estate as soon
as we saw name “Sandal” on it. After driving 1-2 km through coffee
estate we realized we are in wrong place, luckily we found a good
Samaritan who lent his mobile (BSNL) to call our home-stay for more
specific direction. It turned out our home-stay is another 6 KM ahead on
that highway. With more information on route direction we were able to
find our home-stay. This being a first time at home-stay we were bit shy
as we reached at our host’s door. <em>(To be Continued&hellip;.)</em></p>
