While month of September 2014 was supposed to a unique one, It started like just another month of the year.
Honestly it has 17th September which is most times ‘Bishwakarma Puja’ and Pamela’s B’day. From childhood Bishwakarma puja has a special one growing up in Tripura. After Saraswati puja in January/February there was no major festival till Bishwakarma Puja. And there used to pandals and people going out in the evening to visit those pandals.</description></item></channel></rss>
