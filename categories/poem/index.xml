Spiders in bathroom,
The lizards are in the living room,
Rats move when you sleep in the bedroom.
Your worst nightmare is coming for you,
Satan is sending an army for you,
This is my grandmother’s house.
In the granary there you’ll find a large mouse.
Squeak, squeak, squeak.
Doors in this house make creepy
Creak, creak, creak.</description></item><item><title>Independence Day - a poem</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2020-08-17-independence-day-poem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2020 22:02:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2020-08-17-independence-day-poem/</guid><description>2019 August @ Bangalore In the land bordered by the might Himalayas in the North
And by the vast ocean in the South
On 15th August, India celebrates its Independence
from bloody Terrony of foreign powers
and so called &amp;lsquo;British Dependence&amp;rsquo;
All kinds of people, take part in the vast celebration and taste the goodnes of liberation
but, one must understand
that patriotism does not mean celebrating for one day</description></item><item><title>Jungle - a poem</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2020-04-11-jungle-poem/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Apr 2020 22:02:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2020-04-11-jungle-poem/</guid><description>2019 July @ Bangalore A land of leaves
And magnificent beasts
Live with grace
In a Happy place
The JUNGLE is the best place.
Where tigers growl
Squirrel squeak You&amp;rsquo;ll hear heavenly tunes.
Waterfalls roaring
Trees are clapping
Gentle buzzing in the stream
the forest my home I will never leave it.</description></item><item><title>A Paradise</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2020-04-09-a-paradise-poem/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2020 20:48:39 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2020-04-09-a-paradise-poem/</guid><description>2019 August 22nd @ Bangalore I was sitting on a train to paradise.
I exited with my luggage in the midst of midnight with wobbly legs,
I felt like an old soldier with battle fatigue who just came back home.
The end was near, I hauled a cab &amp;amp; into the resort I went.
I was led to a room &amp;amp; immediately bed I went.
So tired, I was asleep before the pillow touched my head.</description></item><item><title>Chamleon</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2020-04-01-chamleon-by-aarush/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 11:35:30 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2020-04-01-chamleon-by-aarush/</guid><description>2020 February 22nd @ Bangalore Slippery, scaly reptilian.
Reptile in general, sniper in nature
eats victims for dinner.
Hunted by poachers
but valued by farmers.
For eliminating pesky pestering pests
weapon of choice is its own tongue;
Must have marksman ship for degree.
Could you guess the animal?
Not a monster,
It is a hidden chameleon.</description></item><item><title>Bats</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2020-04-01-bats-by-aarush/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 11:34:45 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2020-04-01-bats-by-aarush/</guid><description>2020 February 15th @ Calcutta Not your cricket bat nor your baseball bat
but just your friendly animal bat.
Better known as the carrier of disease &amp;amp; death
but is he the black savior of the human kind.
Think again what it can do friend.
Ravages real vampires to the end
mosquitoes everyone till they are in grave.
Killing pestering pests &amp;amp; insects.
Saves 3.5 billion dollars because it does the same thing as the pesticide.</description></item></channel></rss>
