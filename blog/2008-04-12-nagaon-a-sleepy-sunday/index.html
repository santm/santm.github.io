Aarush at Durg. I was looking for an outing from a long time as
completely burn-out with new and old responsibilities at personal and
professional level. Spending weekends, doing absolutely nothing other
than sleeping and delaying all household work for next weekend. Made few
phone calls here and there to old friends to know about their latest
updates.</p><p>Sameer told that they recently bought a small house in <strong>Nagaon</strong> near
‘Alibag’ and he would be visiting soon and asked if I am interested to
come along or not. Without thinking twice I said OK that sounds like a
plan. <strong>Alibag</strong> is in south of Mumbai; just across Mumbai harbor. Some
super rich businessman takes their speed boat from Alibag to commute to
Mumbai. Spending weekend by beach front is very common gateway for
Mumbaikars and there lots of places like these to choose from. Have not
visited many ourselves in last one year as of expected parent we had to
put a complete stop on traveling.</p><p>There was no such formal plan for Sunday but on Saturday evening came to
know that other two who were supposed to join can not make it. So it
left to two of us only. Sameer called me at 6AM informing he started
from Thane and will be reaching Kharghar in next 50 minutes or so. It
was quite early for me but I was ready on time. We hit the road quite
early with the thought of going to Karnala first; do a quick hike before
it is too hot.</p><blockquote><p>Crossing Panvel we stopped at Petrol Station to buy some water bottles
and Sameer decided to fill car as well. But then there was glitch as
those guys in the Pump were unable to connect to Credit-card bank to
swipe our cards and after trying for almost 20 minutes or so we
decided to pay by cash. Together we were only able to put 1167 Rs
still short of few rupees but they let us go. Now there was no ATM
nearby and we had to cross a toll booth soon. To be safe we turned our
car for Panvel. By the time we found one ATM and reached the same
petrol pump again; we lost more than hour and had to cancel Karnala.</p></blockquote><p>The drive was pretty good and we reached Nagaon around 9:30. I was
reading Sunday newspaper while Sameer watered all the new plants. We
headed for Kashid (30 KM south) beach. Drive is more scenic as we cross
few jetties and drive along coconut trees and sea. Kashid beach is clean
and not that crowded but there were enough people. Only thing bothered
us was horse cart. Those horse carts are real nuisance for a beach as
you have horse shit every where. After strolling and spending some time
we headed for lunch. Lunch was simple but it was more than enough. We
went back to Nagaon for a nap. With clean cool air breezing we slept
long enough on Sunday afternoon before returning to Mumbai. End of the
day nothing special but looking forward for more trips likes this to
spend a quite, relaxing and refreshing Sunday.</p></div></div></section><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2008-04-07-shiv-jayanti/ title="Nagaon - a sleepy sunday"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-left" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Previous</a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2008-04-18-perfect-parking/ title="Perfect Parking">Next&nbsp;
