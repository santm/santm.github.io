changed the course of my life as father. Well I am quite positive on
this sudden turn of event that this happened for good. Pamela suddenly
jackpot a teaching Job with one of the premier institute of Bangalore.
And they asked her to join immediately. The first week was in training
in Kormangala was OK OK  as Aarush had his summer camp in his old
school. They also have a day care so he got the adjusted to the same
quite easily for the first week.Well end of the above paragraph does not
qualify for a thought or blog post  and does not  happen in real life ?
The ground reality was very different one but fun filled. The first week
Pamela had to reach to her training by 8:30 and she is not yet
comfortable in driving in Bangalore traffic. So opted for one temporary
driver from an agency while we searched for a permanent one. That
resulted in losing the luxury of car for me. Honestly that was boon and
I am with BMTC Bus. The fun and difficult part was becoming a morning
DAD for Aarush. Now I have to prepare him for school with shower and
breakfast and etc. But to my delight Aarush has been very positive as he
realised this new person is bit different from his beloved mother.We
booked a 2 week vacation in end of May to visit my parental home. My
younger brother will be coming from California and we will celebrate
‘rice ceremony’ for their son (Sheryaan). Now as Pamela can not go we
cancelled our ticket at first thinking to cancel the trip. Now this is
really a big event which we did not want to miss but it means Aarush
have to come with me as he can not be left alone in Bangalore. With that
I need to make fresh booking of Air ticket with some serious dent on my
credit card ? I had to buy the same ticket 3-4 times costlier for myself
and Aarush.I had to make Aarush aware of this upcoming BIG trip every
day morning while preparing his for school. But the D-Day he was
thinking it was more of me going on a trip then himself as the bag was
not that big. But when we got down at Airport he was OK and we quickly
moved through checking and security and boarded the flight. The flight
was a late one starting at 21:00 from Bangalore and reaching Calcutta
close to midnight. In the flight Aarush said he wanted to have some food
which was a very positive thing as after having it he fall asleep. On
reaching Calcutta we took a TAXI and reached a our hotel. A lot of
strange eyes in Calcutta even one asked where is his mother ?? Well as
it was very late Aarush slept easily.</p><p>Next morning we had our flight to Siliguri at noon the postponement was
informed to me in advance. So we left hotel late and had a leisurely
brunch for Aarush and myself. At the airport Aarush opted for Idli (on
of his favorite ) while I slipped a cup of coffee. He was very trilled
with the ATR and it wings compared to yesterday’s jet. And more over it
was a day flight where he could see lots of things. Reaching Siliguri
and at home he was OK. He was a hero to many eyes.  On the day of return
he was very excited to go back to Bangalore and joining Pamela whom he
missed for 4 days.</p><p>The return flight was smooth – Aarush slept on the flight between
Calcutta Bangalore and some paste on reaching Bangalore Airport.</p><p>On 8th June he started his school with DPS. The first three days I need
to go with him and on 13th on-wards he started going by the School Bus.
The new routine is very demanding as Aarush have to get ready in 50 min
to reach Bus-Stop within Godrej Campus by 07:30 AM. Every morning he
suggests it is a holiday at school but once in Bus he is OK. It is
already 2 weeks he is going by Bus and coming back to Day-care where he
will have his lunch and nap and then Pamela picks him up while returning
from School. So far so good with the new role but it is really demanding
one for sure.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>We watched &lsquo;taare zameen par&rsquo; one weekend though he loves the song
&lsquo;Bum Bum Bole&rsquo; the whole school system, punishment, separation from
family made him sad he did not like the whole thing about Ishan.
 Looks like  it was not a good idea to watch it with him.</p></blockquote></blockquote></div></div></section><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2011-05-04-madurai/ title="Father Day - Thank you Aarush"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-left" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Previous</a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2011-07-01-page-speed-web-site-broken/ title="Page Speed - Web site broken">Next&nbsp;
