trip waiting to be jotted down before it gets erased from our memory. A
trip to Berlin where present and past are in sync once again.</p><p>We went there for 3days- 2 nights stay by train on Easter weekend when
sky was gloomy and mercury dropped to almost freezing point but didn’t
deter our enthu to explore city as much possible. We took overnight
train from Paris which reached at very early hours. We bought metro (u –
Bahn) day pass tickets before going to our pre-booked Novotel hotel.</p><p>After taking our room key we left to meet Berliners, no longer East or
West Berliners but just Berliners. Had a takeaway breakfast on a way
from one of the bakery shop at metro station and got off at Zoologischer
Garten Bahnhof to visit Kudamm. It is here that the KaDeWe the largest
departmental store in all of continental Europe stands. If you don&rsquo;t
have a lot of time to browse the whole store at least pay a visit to the
top floor which is Mecca for foodies. We also checked both BMW and
Mercedes showrooms where you find designer items other than car designed
by those famous engineering and designer with perfections.</p><p>We walked to Berlin’s famous landmark Kaiser Wilhelm Gedächtniskirche
rebuild itself but not at the cost of wiping its past. The ruins of
Kaiser Wilhelm memorial church stand as reminder of the suffering of the
war, right next to its hexagonal bell tower very much building of the
present. The church is a reinforced concrete structure with blue-colored
glass bricks while Memorial hall has still some of the mosaic decoration
that survived the bombing.</p><p>From here we hopped onto <strong>double-decker bus line no 100</strong> famous among
tourists as it crosses most of historic Berlin.</p><blockquote><p>Tip: Sit at top as it&rsquo;s easier to get a view of most top sights like
Reichstag, as well as the many other historic buildings on Unter den
Linden.</p></blockquote><p>Got down at Alexanderplatz to see Berlin’s 365 metre high TV tower. Next
to the TV tower is located the gothic Marienkirche, the second oldest
church (built in late 13th century) of the historical centre of Berlin.
It is close to river spree and surrounded by few notable buildings with
red-brick roof and right across the street was Starbucks – had coffee
there. I do not drink coffee but those chilly winds outside we took
shelters few times where Santanu tried to give quick <em>dégustation</em> class
on coffee. From here we walked to Berlin Cathedral built between 1895
and 1905. We even climbed to the top of dome to take panoramic view. It
faces the Lustgarten (pleasure garden) and the Berliner Stadtschloss
(berlin city palace). Lustgarten is a park on Museum Island. It houses
Altes museum (old museum) which we visited later.</p><p>It was dusk when we were waiting in a long queue to visit Reichstag -
German parliament near the Brandenburg gate building with large glass
dome and access to top with a great view of Berlin. Although free
entrance but extensive security check and at same time its worth
visiting.</p><p>Then, we went to see Germany’s iconic landmark Brandenburg Gate at
historical center and nucleus of former East Berlin district Mitte. This
is where it’s all happening. It’s numéro one place to be seen and to
see. Cafes, bars restaurants, theatres, designer shops selling
everything from shoes to scarves; day or night places along with many
other sites of historic interest are teeming with people. It is new
hangout for young and restless. In the very heart of Berlin is a
memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe which we didn’t visited as it
was already dark.</p><p>Lastly, went to house of world culture centre for non European art whose
floor was superbly decorated… no doubt. Had dinner at one of Chinese
restaurant near Zoologischer Garten and left for our hotel.</p></div></div></section><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2007-11-30-milan-shopping-trip-came-to-end/ title="Berlin Diary"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-left" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Previous</a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2007-12-07-berlin-diary-ii/ title="Berlin Diary II">Next&nbsp;
