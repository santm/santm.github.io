baby shower was done in the Bengali traditional way which is called as
<strong>Saadh</strong> in Bengali. It is meant mostly to pamper the first-time mother
to be and cheer her up as she accumulates courage to face the most
testing time in her life which will soon change her life in and out.
Normally, held in the <strong>seventh or ninth month</strong> of pregnancy on a
specified day when mother-in-law will organize this ceremony. She will
invite all the women she knows. Thus this ceremony is mainly for women
only.</p><p>In our custom, M-I-L presents all the garments which mother-to-be wears
at the ceremony. This occasion happens twice once from in-laws side is
over then only my mom can have but because of my critical condition,
from both sides were done on a single day in the seventh month.</p><p>Expected mother have to sit on the floor facing east and sometimes puja
is also performed; but as I was medically unfit to sit for a longer
duration so certain rituals were curtailed. <strong>Alpana</strong> (with powdered
rice) designs are usually drawn on the floor. In the middle of the
design, an earthen or copper pot is kept decorated with a red swastika
and filled with pure water, mango leaves and green coconut is kept. This
is considered as an auspicious sign.</p><p><a href=../images/2009-02-05-my-baby-shower-sadh.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2009-02-05-my-baby-shower-sadh.jpg alt></a></p><p>Mom and mother-in-law of the prospective mother fill her lap,
represented by the aanchal of her sari with items. Generally,
mother-in-law will first bless with ululating the expectant mother as
well her unborn child and then put items like 7 different types of <strong>dry
fruits, fresh fruits, sweets</strong> etc in the lap which will be followed by
other invited married women. Had a wonderful time with all elders
wishing me luck in their own way.</p><p>Last but not least expected mother is fed well with seven different
types of savory traditional dishes. A feast is prepared for the guests
as well. In Bengali, no ceremony be it a wedding or baby shower is
complete without elaborate serving rituals, but nowadays professional
catering or buffet-style dining is common. The courses progress from
lighter to richer and heavier. Rice remains common throughout the
meal.</p><p>Starting course is bitter a soupy mixture of vegetables in a
ginger-mustard sauce, called <strong>shukto</strong>. Followed by <strong>Dal</strong> <em>lentil
curry</em> - the most substantial course accompanied with <strong>fritters</strong>
(bhaja). In fritters <strong>tailfin</strong> and <strong>head of fish</strong> is must to be
served to expected mother. The next course is two kinds of <strong>vegetable
curry</strong> which is followed by <strong>fish</strong> course of two varieties. Finally
comes the <strong>chutney</strong> course, which is typically tangy and sweet;
usually made of mangoes or tomatoes or pineapple etc. And of course at
last sweet dish be it <em>rice pudding</em> (<strong>kheer</strong>) or <strong>rasogulla</strong> is
served which is not to be missed.</p></div></div></section><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2009-02-04-journey-to-motherhood/ title="My baby shower"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-left" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Previous</a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2009-02-10-lavazza-in-india/ title="Lavazza in India">Next&nbsp;
