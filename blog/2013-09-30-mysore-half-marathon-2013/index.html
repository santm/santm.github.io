Pacemakers running group. Coach was brand ambassador of the run, we had
a promo run in Bangalore for the same. Few runners from group also got
featured in <a href=http://www.lifeiscalling-sports.com/mysore-running-mascots/ title="Mysore Running Mmascots">Life is Calling&rsquo;s web
site</a>.</p><p>Initially I was against this run as I rescheduled my Mother&rsquo;s return
flight from Bangalore to Siliguri on the same Sunday :(. But big thanks
to Maa and Pamela as they supported to run me this event. Initial plan
was Pamela to drop Maa at airport, but at the end Maa said she would go
via Taxi of her own. I traveled in car with fellow runners post lunch on
Saturday and with small coffee break reached Mysore around 18:30. We had
a simple South-Indian rice meal - a well carb-loading with rice. The
hotel we stayed was 100 meters from the start/finish line.</p><p>On the race day we did not had to wake up that early compared to
weekends run as run was starting at 06:30. Prepared myself for a hot day
with a very light sleeve-less , ca and sun-glass. Was double minded
about the tee as it felt little chilled as we walked out of the hotel.
But as soon as did warm-up felt great about the choice of attire.</p><p>Initial plan I had in my mind was to stick with one lady runner from our
group and try to finish as best I could. We started together but around
2KM mark there was little down hill and I continued my pace which I was
comfortable once I go ahead from her. I continued my own pace and most
time did not checked my garmin at all. I knew I was running faster than
normal weekend runs but there was no discomfort. Around the lake where
we took &ldquo;U&rdquo; turn could see all the the elites were coming back and a
majority of them were from our group. Around 17 and 18 KM I wish the
finish line was nearer as mind always plays devil game at the end.</p><p>The last 500 Meters there were Pacemakers waiting to cheers and pace the
last part. I tired my best to push myself and get get a 1:50 finish.
Well a minute shorter I would have beat my own record from 2003. But the
length of the race is not 21.1 so if I really need to finish 1:50 next
time I need to save 2/3 minutes overall and a target of around 1:45
would be dream come true.</p><p>Special thank to
