It started like just another</p><p>month of the year.</p><p>Honestly it has 17th September which is most times ‘Bishwakarma Puja’</p><p>and Pamela’s B’day and that is how I remember it. From childhood</p><p>Bishwakarma puja has a special mention growing up in Tripura. After</p><p>Saraswati puja in January/February there was no major festival till</p><p>Bishwakarma Puja. And there used to pandals and people going out in the</p><p>evening to visit those pandals. Also soon after Bishwakarma Puja the</p><p>annual festival season starts where we celebrate Durga Puja and others.</p><p>And normally the weather would be great where monsoon is over and</p><p>climate were getting pleasant. </p><p>But you ask about the weather for 2014 it is a mixed bag. The monsoon</p><p>was delayed in Bangalore there was hardly much rain during June and</p><p>July. The rain started to pick up in September and October and we had</p><p>2014 a one of the wettest year in recent time where there was traffic</p><p>chaos and what now when it rained heavily for few days in September and</p><p>October.</p><p>Personally was in a training plan to run my first Marathon(42.2KM) with</p><p>practice with maiden Bengaluru Marathon. But my training came to</p><p>grinding halt as suddenly things at family took a turn for worse. Pamela</p><p>had to rush to Durg to take care of her father who was sadly</p><p>hospitalized after a severe fall. Me and Aarush managed well in</p><p>Bangalore. It was bit of a driving as I had to drop him early in the</p><p>west of Bangalore and come to work in the east. </p><p>End of September the price of IPhone 5 started to drop in Indian on-line</p><p>stores. Last year (2013) I also noticed the same for one phone which I</p><p>was willing to spend but ten realized the price starts to go up after</p><p>the initial offer. So this year I made no mistake and booked one IPhone</p><p>5s for 33K and there was some cashback offers from leading credit card</p><p>companies. Ironically the price of 5s now at 42K INR after the Iphone 6</p><p>came to market. Not sure who will buy a older product when the newer one</p><p>is not that far off. A person who is willing to spent 42K Sure will</p><p>justify a spent of 53K for the latest model. </p><p>I am not an apple fan boy but have to admit the phone is what I was</p><p>looking for ? and loving it so far so good.</p><p>The Durga puja was a special one as we celebrated the same in Bangalore</p><p>with one of my beloved maternal-aunt and her family. So we have the</p><p>usual pendal hopping eating outside. The 3 days just flew away. </p><p><a href=../images/2014-12-03-sharat-when-rains-give-way-to-the-early-autumn-with-blue-skies-mid-august-to-mid-october-10711131_10152795461868470_7708311552882035105_n.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2014-12-03-sharat-when-rains-give-way-to-the-early-autumn-with-blue-skies-mid-august-to-mid-october-10711131_10152795461868470_7708311552882035105_n.jpg alt></a></p><p>Now with all that came my birthday which was a very simple affair as</p><p>things was not great again in Durg. And 4 days after that was Bangalore</p><p>marathon. I had to make a hard choice of either run a Half Marathon or</p><p>crawl a full marathon and after lot of deliberation I opted for the 1st</p><p>one. It was an wise decision as I was struggling with 26 KM after coming</p><p>back to running after an month. </p><p><a href=../images/2014-12-03-sharat-when-rains-give-way-to-the-early-autumn-with-blue-skies-mid-august-to-mid-october-1234375_10152801834383470_6365127152255977949_n.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2014-12-03-sharat-when-rains-give-way-to-the-early-autumn-with-blue-skies-mid-august-to-mid-october-1234375_10152801834383470_6365127152255977949_n.jpg alt></a></p><p>So here is my quick report on Bangalore Marathon. </p><p><strong>1:47:10 @ Avg 5:03!!</strong></p><p>Enjoyed the race, did not had any target in mind at start other than</p><p>finishing strong. Enjoyed the run and went with family for the Charity</p><p>run after that. Here is my splits looks like if I practice well a 1:45</p><p>for HM in a good race is a possible target. Special thanks to</p><p>Kothandapani Sir and my extended family of PaceMakers. UNfortunately the</p><p>world media picked one news which was not great when lead pack of</p><p>runners lost race route. The race organizers were great who shared the</p><p>price money to these individuals in later days.</p><p>Thankfully I picked up long running again on the weekends and back to</p><p>30+KM on weekends but still a full marathon looks so daunting task.</p></div></div></section><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2014-09-02-airtel-hyderabad-half-marathon-2014/ title=Sharat><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-left" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Previous</a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2014-12-07-what-a-saturday/ title="What a Saturday">Next&nbsp;
