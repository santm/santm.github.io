preparation can ever prepare fully for it.</em> We are learning about our
little helpless bundle and same probably on his side. After returning
from official trip santanu was agog to spent more time with Aarush as if
it was ages he has spent not seeing him.</p><p>Aarush now learnt to squeal in delight as his arms flail about in the
air above him. Cooing and soft throaty sounds were heard from him time
to time. Sometimes if he is in good mood he use to play of his own for
few min. with his arms and legs.</p><p>His tiny hands use to tug our hair. Music use to be one of his favorite.
Bright colors catches his attention. We figured out this month he is
(still he is&mldr;) <strong>fan of ceiling fan</strong>; he loves ceiling fans so
much&mldr;. no matter on or off. Whenever he is moved to any new place,
first thing he tries to locate is ceiling fan. And as soon as he gets to
look at the fan we switch it on and he would give a million dollar
smile. Sometimes while crying, if he happens to spots the fan, he
giggles a bit and then resumes his crying session.</p><p><a href=../images/2009-04-04-second-month-aarush-2ndmonth.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2009-04-04-second-month-aarush-2ndmonth.jpg alt></a></p><p>This month he got DPT triple antigent shots causing a little fever. But
he was not at all cranky only thing was he did not play much that
evening with his hands and legs.</p><p>At first he didn&rsquo;t use to enjoy oil massage but slowly started liking
it. If held in a standing position, he use to support his body with the
legs. His neck was not yet firm. His head use to wobble if not held
properly. Santanu also tried his hand in giving him evening massage â€“
and Aarush too liked it.</p><p>While Aunts and uncles rejoiced his arrival, friends called up to
congratulate. His maternal aunt was so happy on his arrival that she
sent one box full of clothes and needful things through courier.</p><p>After my mom left on march 9th - hubby and I went about in a daze not
quite sure how we were supposed to handle little screaming, pooping
bundle that we had. But those two days he comported himself. And after 2
days we too flew from bombay to durg without much fuss. That was his
<strong>first air travel</strong>. Maybe Aarush was happy to be in secure hands while
I was not much interested to go to Durg but Santanu and his mom wanted
us to be there for a while.</p><p>His grandparents (my parents) were very happy to see him there. One maid
was appointed for me as well Aarush for oil massage twice a day.</p></div></div></section><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2009-04-03-playing-trumpet/ title="Second month"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-left" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Previous</a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2009-04-12-visit-to-north-kerala-wayanad/ title="Visit to North kerala- Wayanad">Next&nbsp;
