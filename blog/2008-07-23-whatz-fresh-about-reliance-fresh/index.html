supermarket and open markets as we settle in. This is also giving us as
chance to explore places around. The first one we tried and explored was
<strong>BIG-BAZAR</strong> on Old Madras road. As it is just near to one of our
office address in Bangalore I knew how to reach there without being
lost. Then weekend after we tried <strong>SPAR</strong> at Kormongala followed by
<strong>Nilgiris</strong>. Hypermarket Spar is having veggies like asparagus, lettuce
leaves, endive which are rarley seen. Other then that one can find
chesse like brie, blue cheese, parmesan, ricotta, emmental, gouda, feta
etc. In between we have ventured many small to medium scale stores like
<strong>More</strong>, <strong>SMART</strong> and others. There was no particular pattern.</p><p>While going towards Sarjapur junction on Outer Ring Road we saw sign of
<strong>Reliance Fresh</strong>; last night decided to check it out. To our horror we
were welcomed by stinking smell; yes it was the only thing out there.
The floor was very untidy, every thing was falling from the shelves,
nothing organized at all, with stale veggies. Top of it, store people
were not at all bothered, nor very friendly to customers. To our
observations Nilgiris is very neat and tidy, well organized and managed
while Big-Bazar with its vastness and madness of crowd keeps the show
running although one might have to spend few hrs in queue at
cash-counter mainly on week-ends.</p><p>Your comments are most welcome to share your views on super markets.
