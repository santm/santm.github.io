<a href=http://blog.santm.com/2012/04/02/anandhadam/ title=anandhadam>Anandhama</a>
we pushed for Yercaud as it gave us a perfect destination of little bit
driving and get away from Bangalore heat. We did not booked any hotel as
we kept everything for last minute.  So on the D’day we left basement
parking around 5AM to avoid Bangalore traffic.And we did hate to
navigate rush escaping traffics from Bangalore. We stopped for a quick
stop after crossing Tamilnadu border to fill the tank and realized
somehow fuel tank release was not working. After playing with
screwdrivers it finally opened which was a great relief otherwise we
would have to wait till 9/10 for a mechanic. As usual stopped at A2B
before Krishnagiri for Breakfast.We crossed Salem town and took the road
to Yercaud. Soon we were on the hill road which gain altitude quite
quickly with many twist and 20 sharp hairpins bends. But driving these
32 KM was fun, The first hotel we enquired for accommodation was GRT but
the price they were offering on spot was bit steep for our budget. Bit
disappointed there as last night when we checked the same on internet it
was showing quite low with discount. May be the GRT guys will save those
offers for late comers as days come to end. Next we tried Shevaroys
resort near lake and decided to stay there for the night. This is an old
landmark resort in Yercaud. The place is a decent one but would
recommend you check on internet before deciding on this.</p><p>We wanted to visited the famous Botanical Garden but it was closed due
to weekend (what a weird place who keeps their top destination closed
for tourist). May be they do not want any visitors ?. We drove towards
Servarayan temple and Cauvery Point road. On the way Aarush fell asleep
and we went to Pagoda point. Pagoda gives a nice view of the plain
below. From there we went to Lady&rsquo;s Seat & Gent&rsquo;s Seat .Here, we could
see the ghat road from Salem via which we reached Yercaud. We also got
the ariel view of GRT hotel. Next to this was Horticulture Farm and it
has Rose graden. There was not a single rose as they were freshly
trimmed so we have to make ourselfves happy with other green beauties.</p><p>We came to hotel and it was around 15:00 and went straight for a very
late lunch and by this time Aarush also woke up. After lunch we went for
a small plantation walk within the resort which is pretty nice. Aarush
had some fun time in the children&rsquo;s play area. Finally, we entered room;
got freshen up & took a beauty sleep and had an early dinner same
evening.</p><p>Next day, we went for a morning walk around lake before breakfast and
after breakfast we visited famous Montfort School. This school was
started for anglo-indians around WW-I. The architecture and natural
beauty around it is really worth spending some time there. It is a one
of the convent residential institution in South India. The school was
having admissions test on that day and we could only spot expensive cars
and anxious parents who were dressed in their best.</p><p>After that we returned to room and started for Bangalore. On the way we
stopped at A2B just after crossing Dharmapuri for lunch. Aaursh was very
sleepy but he played role of a cranky child all along. After Hosur, we
forced him to sleep and reached home safely in next hour.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>The NH7 was excellent with many toll plazas which was constantly
emptying my wallet ;) so not sure is it the best hill station or not
but definitely it did not felt crowded like Coorg.</p></blockquote></blockquote></div></div></section><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2012-04-03-anandhadam/ title="Yercaud - March'12"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-left" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Previous</a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2012-08-02-kanyakumari-where-the-seas-meet/ title="Kanyakumari : Where the Seas Meet">Next&nbsp;
