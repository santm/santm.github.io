voice of Pamela’s Lumia more attentively and with ease we head out of
Hospet and join the highway. The highway NH-13 between Hospet and
Bijapur is recently widen to 4 lane. It was a pleasure driving, the road
was not at all crowded and surprisingly the trucks maintained the left
lane. Was driving around 110/120 KMph without any trouble and soon
reached Hungund. From there we took left turn towards Aihole.</p><p><a href=../images/2013-01-01-aihole-and-patadkal-Aihole-Patadkal.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2013-01-01-aihole-and-patadkal-Aihole-Patadkal.jpg alt></a></p><p>There are plenty of sign for Aihole but when we reached we were greeted
with a rustic village. There was no guides or local man asking us and by
mistake we crossed the village and started with Jain Temple which is
located on the isolated back side of the hill.</p><p>From there we came to village and visited – Hucchappayya Math Complex,
Mallikarjuna Complex, Ravana Pahdi & Hucchimalli temple complex. Aarush
had little snack while the car was under a tree shade. But the sun again
was too hot and scotching hot. All these places we were the only visitor
most of the times.</p><p>From there we went to Durga temple complex – the key attraction of
Aihole. This time we found guide and after little bargain we hired one.
After 90  minutes of tour we called it a day in Aihole.</p><p>The construction & sculpture at Aihole is considered the basic or
primary for Karnataka. This is the very place where people inspired by
Ellora started their love affair with stone.</p><p>From there we took the road towards Patadkal. The roads is a typical
village road and the sun was very hard on us.  We reached there around
15:00; we did not had any proper lunch as there was no suitable place
along the road to stop. We waited in the car had little more snacks &
fruits that we had with us. We got in to the UNESCO Heritage site around
15:30 when the shadow got little longer. We hired a guide and without
him the true beauty and history of this place would have remained
unknown to us. There are seven temples dedicated mostly to Lord Shiva.
Other than one remaining six is not functional as either the idol is
broken or missing. The key of Patadakal is unique mix of South and North
Indian temples. After 2 hours of trip down the memory lane we called it
a day and left for Badami. As soon as we came out of the main temple
complex we found the lone Jain temple on our right hand side and we did
a quick stop there.</p><p>The road to Badami with orange sunlight with the backdrop of hills was
very beautiful. The rocks were glowing with soft sunlight. We reached
Badami before sunset and ordered some coffee and snacks as we reached
our hotel Badami Court.</p><p>Dinner was a simple one, and after a long day we hit the bed early.</p><p><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/santm/sets/72157638597315665/>Pictures from
