This place was in such an area where proper roads were not there….it was full of potholes and filled with rainwater from previous rains. One thing is there Guwahati inner roads are not great and even city is not that clean&mldr;full of plastics. Anyways we zoomed out from that place without much wastage of time and hit the highway.</p><p>We were recommended to have breakfast on the way at <strong>Jiva resort</strong> but which we could never find nor even any hoarding-related to that. This Guwahati-Shillong road is very good because of which it hardly took 2-2.5 hrs to reach near Bada Pani (Umiam lake).</p><h2 id=umiam-lake>Umiam Lake</h2><p>When we reached it was a clear sky with no sun though. Then we were looking forward to boating area so that we can go near the lake. There was a sign for Umiam lake which we followed and it took us to orchid lake resort and very close to it has a garden with boating area. We decided to have a look at it first and then have breakfast. The moment we reached here, we were followed by some gujju families too&mldr;we did some photo session there. The serene lake is surrounded by
thick coniferous forests. One can take a long boat ride in the lake, and adventure lovers can enjoy boating and various water-sports. There are a few islands in the lake that can be used as pit-stops if one requires a moment of rest while boating through the lake.</p><p>We slowly proceed towards <strong>Orchid Lake Resort</strong> to have our breakfast. We were offered with buffet breakfast which was 300 INR for adults. Their dining hall has a high ceiling and at the centre, a fireplace for winters or maybe night time. Dining Hall windows face towards lakefront and their garden which is nicely maintained.</p><h2 id=shillong>Shillong</h2><p>We had our breakfast which was more of brunch and then took a tour of their lake facing the garden and headed straight to Shillong road towards the city. Our Google map guided us to through numerous twists and turns of narrow lanes. On our very fast left turn we too such a narrow cut that felt almost we would <strong>topple</strong> but the traffic police smiled and signaled us to proceed ahead. it was a scary start for what time coming next as we drive though twisted small roads.</p><p>We were looking out for Happy-Valley which made us really unhappy at one point of time that we gave up hope but somehow managed to reach army area where we stopped to ask them about the area we were looking for. Phone signal was pretty bad at that moment of time and even when it went the person on other side was not responding so we were not sure to proceed or stop there.</p><p>For civilians all Assam Regiments look the same, so with a lot of confusion in mind, we went down the hill where it seems there is another base camp which is having the guest room we were looking for. On reaching there, we got the hone signal we were looking forward. Then on entering our next job was to find the guest house but looks like we ended up in some official area which was deserted. After a while, we could locate someone who guided us with one jawan to our room.</p><p>We were introduced to our room buddy, who was so kind.  <em>”Sir, Would you like to have something for lunch”</em></p><p>NO (we are too full to have any)</p><p><em>“Sir, if you have any problem or complaint, related to anything, please first contact me”.</em></p><p>We were surprised to hear that but we smiled and replied: “ Don’t worry we are fine.”</p><p>We were actually taken back to see the room with slipper, comb, razor etc. with a proper kitchen where one can cook too for themselves if needed.</p><p>As the day became more & more brighter we decided to go for city tour but in meantime, our host called to know our whereabouts and our plan. As we said our plan he proposed to take his army gypsy to police bazar to avoid parking and entry through their gates which will need permission again. By the time he came personally to check if everything
was fine with us or not.</p><p>In the meanwhile, his gypsy came and we left for police bazaar which was as usual crowded. The driver stopped us near the square and asked us to call once done to which we agreed upon. We strolled through the street. From young to old, the woman looks dazzling, dressed in their traditional attire (<strong>jainsem</strong>), which they pair with matching cardigans and heels. The street was busy with cozy cafes, restaurants and small umbrella shops and varieties of footwear. Side road was busy with their black <em><strong>Maruti 800 cab</strong></em> (public transport).</p><p>We walked towards <strong>Ward’s Lake</strong> which is closer to Governor&rsquo;s house. This lake also has a cafeteria and a Botanical Garden, we paid entry fees and then crossed one wooden bridge which takes to another side of the lake. It&rsquo;s nice to watch people boating and feeding fish.</p><p>We took the privilege of perfect evening sunlight and did time pass photography all over the garden. This garden has a lot to offer in terms of floral bed, bamboo trees and cobbled pathway, nicely manicured plants. As we strolled around, we too started feeling hungry and as the Sun was going further west we decided to move back to police bazar area for some light snacks.</p><p>Went to Grover&rsquo;s eatery, which was right at the corner on the first floor of the shopping complex. It has nice decor tastefully done but takes time for food to reach the table. After having some soups and momos we left from there as we had to go to our host&rsquo;s place for dinner.</p><p>We had a nice evening with soothing music in the background. Mrs. Nayyar pampered us with an elaborate spread of starters and main course. It was really nice of <em><strong>(colonel) Mr. and Mrs .Nayyar</strong></em> to host us. We deeply appreciate their role and thanks them from bottom of our heart to be part of our memorable journey.</p><blockquote><p>Stay: At Army Basecamp</p></blockquote></div></div></section><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2018-05-19-day-1-maa-kamakhya-here-we-come/ title="Shillong, Day-2 -- Assam & Meghalaya Trip 2018"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-left" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Previous</a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2018-10-16-kerala-2018-thekkady-and-thattekad/ title="Kerala 2018 Thekkady and Thattekad">Next&nbsp;
