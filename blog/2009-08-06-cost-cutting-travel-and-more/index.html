horrible service from any airline in my travel history. For Airlines
each seats are perishable commodities, which is lost as soon as the
flight takes off and it is a dream come true for Airline Company when
they have one. But looks like <strong>Singapore Airline (SIA)</strong> staffs not
adequately trained to handle such pressure. The dinner was served at
1:30 AM while the flight was on time at 23:00PM. Neither they came with
coffee or tea after dinner, may be most passenger would not have asked
for the same but still they should have don’t they&mldr; ? I pressed the
button for extra water but no one attended me.</p><p>While returning from Singapore person at counter was very strict about
extra luggage. I had to adjust extra 2 Kgs that I had which was
something new for me. For the first time, I had to do that …. blame it
on <a href=http://www.ikea.com/><strong>IKEA</strong></a> . Anyways, the famous courteousness
of SIA staff was totally missing when I asked for priority level for my
check-in. And this time I did ensured my seat on-line prior to flying.
In-flight service was much better this time as the flight was very much
empty. May be only half or less and service was comparable to old times.</p><p>But on whole it looks like entire Singapore is going through a cost
cutting measure to turn around their economy. They issued me a 2 year
VIA on simple A4 paper. Not sure if that paper is going to last or not.
And clearly SIA staffs donot know what to do when the flight is full
which is really a BIG disappointment.</p><blockquote><p>I ensured to share the same feedback to SIA website and hope for the
better service next time.</p></blockquote></div></div></section><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2009-07-21-depuis-longtemps/ title="Cost cutting Travel and more"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-left" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Previous</a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2009-08-15-seventh-month/ title="Seventh month">Next&nbsp;
