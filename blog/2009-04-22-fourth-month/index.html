no outing for him. As he is considered too small for all these by my
parents. So they neither allow him nor me to go anywhere. After birth it
was third time when Aarush was taken out of the house to meet people
other then his doc&rsquo;s clinic. Moreover because of weather it was
difficult for us to go anywhere. Worst thing about his nanu&rsquo;s place was
sultry sun(temperature reaching <strong>49 º C</strong>) because of which most of the
time he use to be in front of air cooler.</p><p>On other hand, its truly becoming irresistible for his dad I suppose. As
he came again to meet his son at April end - his heart was at Durg and
mind at Mumbai.</p><p>By now our lil one was able to keep himself engaged by holding a rattle
in his hand for quite some time. His maternal aunt along with two sissys
came to meet him. They were with us for a month. This month was full of
entertainment for him with so many people to take care. His sissys were
too excited to have him as their brother. They use to play a lot with
him even tell him stories while he use to listen very carefully without
any noise – as if he understands everything.</p><p><a href=../images/2009-04-22-fourth-month-aarush_tini.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2009-04-22-fourth-month-aarush_tini.jpg alt></a></p><p>Quite often he use to cry in irregular pattern. At first, it made us
difficult to understand what actual problem is. Was it out of hunger or
feeling hot or some uneasiness. Every few hrs he will cry as he is
hungry. Me and my parents were worried that he may be suffering from
colic, but then again, he slept well when it was time for him to sleep
and played and laughed happily in excitement when he was being teased.
However, when it was time for milk, he just refused to take in much,
often taking only few ounces. Certain nights were really miserable as I
had to feed him after every 2hrs. Since I was with my parents it was of
great help at these times. They use to take care of him while I use to
catch some sleep at day hours.</p><p>It seems this problem is common among babies at this stage, and whenever
they get hungry, they would drink. With Aarush, the slightest noise or
movement distraction would make him turn away in curiosity, no matter
how much I try putting back in his mouth. Now he drinks his milk
whenever he is hungry, not on any schedule.</p></div></div></section><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2009-04-15-third-month/ title="Fourth month"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-left" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Previous</a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2009-04-28-playing-with-bubbles/ title="playing with bubbles">Next&nbsp;
