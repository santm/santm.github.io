that you have to stay long to explore all the corners. Food is highly
influenced by <em>Malaysian, Chinese, Indonesian and none other but South
Indian</em> too. Even annually Singapore government organizes <strong>“Singapore
Food Festival”</strong> in month of July. I was lucky enough to get a glimpse
of it. When it is a matter of food I consider myself to be “<strong>not a
typical desi</strong>” sticking only to one variety of food. I love to explore
as much as I can. But of course at same time I try to avoid certain meat
other then duck, chicken, turkey,lamb or goat. So, after that only
sausages or bacons can make way to my plate with choice rest I do not
like to taste due to various personal reasons. Well, please <em>do not be
surprised as I went very specific with meat</em>. As, according to French
there are so many delicious delicacies to taste ; that do not think only
about Chinese or Korean if you are a vegetarian.</p><p>Recently, I had <strong>Red chilli chicken</strong> from a western wok at my lunch.
For lunch, we have a food court opposite to our Singapore office. It is
not specific to any company; it seems there are few others nearby as
well. Variation ranges from <em>Indian to Japanese to even cross-cultural
fusion</em>. So a lot to choose from if you can figure out. I am not sure
sometime what they have as main-ingredients. But this dish was simple to
order as it said red chili chicken with rice. But, astonishing part was
the numbers of chilies it had. At first, I was bit skeptical about its
spiciness with so many chillies in plate but later I took a bite of one
of those and found they are not as hot as they looked. A Good experience
indeed:D.</p><p>The second picture of <strong>Fish curry</strong> is from a food court eatery; the
curry was excellent… very close to Indian kind but then the down hill
journey started for me. They said - you can choose two veggies as side
dish and I opted for Spinach and peanut sauce. I specifically asked
about the Peanut one as they mentioned it will be melange of sweet and
sour savour. When I was ordering my plate it looked like that sauce had
some sprouts but thank god I am not a vegetarian - infact it had some
dry fish. But, as a whole this side-dish was a big thumbs down which
changed my taste-buds …yuck!!! :.(</p></div></div></section><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2007-08-06-sale/ title="Exploring…Bits n Bites"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-left" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Previous</a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2007-08-14-exploring-bits-n-bites-ii/ title="Exploring…bits n bites II">Next&nbsp;
