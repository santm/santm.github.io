was a crazy
week,
as usual, it always happens that the week is very bad for
work, commute and
others just before we go on
vacation and come back. So somehow we finished our packing on Thursday
night and set our alarms for early Friday.</p><p>We
woke up on time and got ready and then call for Uber, the app shows the
taxi is just next to our apartment where normally few Uber/Ola always
are found. on tracking it was found no movement, I call the number and
no one picks. After trying few times I gave up and cancel my trip. Again
book another Uber and this time the guys picks up the phone and promised
to be there in 5 minutes. The cab was an old one the headlight was
barely working asked him to switch on the headlight and his response it
is already on. Well, finger crossed we reached airport and journey to
Delhi was in peace.  </p><p>We
landed on time and called our car rental company they told us to come to
a designated spot but the wait was quite long. The representative does
the handover outside Airport area near Aero City Metro (Mahipalpur
junction). Signed few documents took pictures of the car. There were
lots of dents around ( nothing surprising a rented car in Delhi). The
car had around 53K KM on ODO. What was bad is that the car came with
very low fuel where the pre-sale promise was it will come with full tank
fuel. Now it was already 11 and the traffic was horrible and we started
our journey in crawling speed. The names were familiar but I could not
recollect anything about Delhi, like Bhikaji Kama, AIMS, SouthEx&mldr; .</p><p>We
crossed Jamuna and stopped for UP road tax. Now the real UP wala feeling
came alive. The tool was only 120/- but the guy wanted 170/- When asked
50/- is his fees for which there was no receipt. After raising
my voice little and asking what is wrong it was agreed at 150/-. We
crossed Noida and then entered Ghaziabad.  Traffic was getting little
better but the day was getting hotter and hotter. Now I was desperate to
find a petrol station. Thanks, Google Maps we had to take few U-turns
very confidently as for no reason it asks you to take a road when your
common road sense also tells you it is very wrong. We saw a massive
amount of newly constructed apartments and people are waving their hands
to the car so take a look. Indian realty market did not look that
promising.  We fill our car and then stopped for a quick bite. The food
was OK but the moment we come back the car felt like a furnace.</p><p>The
road google map took us bypassed Ghaziabad, Meerut, Muzaffarnagar,
Roorkee, Dehradun for Mussoorie.  </p><p>We
stopped before Roorkee to pay road tax for Uttarakhand but now this time
has to give 300/- to that guy for which there was no receipt. It was a
tent where these private operators are working. Only good thing I
understood what needs to be done for next time as he did the process in
front of me on the computer.</p><p>As
soon as we entered Roorkee the roads just disappeared for some good
distance. It was back to crawling speed and minute maneuvering. And it
seems there is no real bypass as the whole town was on the road.  At
last, the road got better as we escaped out of Roorkee. We passed
Dehradun around 5/5:30 PM. And from there uphill of 20KM started to
reach Mussoorie. We were told the road will be tricky but found it OK.
We reached Mussoorie when the sun just went down completely behind the
mountains.</p><p>As
usual like any other British hill station this also has Mall road, and
we anticipated that it will be closed to vehicular traffic in the
evening. And it was so we had to find a public parking and park our car
there. It was a transition from the driving on plains as roads here get
really narrow.</p><p>We
checked in our hotel GMVN and oh! No, it was a not a room we were
expecting. The staffs were courteous but very slow in response.   I
really feel bad as most of our hotels are GMVN/KMVN for next 10 days. We
walked to another end of the Mall road and had a good dinner. The place
was very crowded, but we all have tested better Chinese food. Maybe our
choice was not great as the dishes we ordered were extremely spicy or
oily.</p><p>Now
with a little sore mood, we headed back to the hotel and left Aarush for
sleeping as we walked back to get our car back to the hotel.</p><p>Oh
boy! what a parking. You go steeply down from the Coffee day and then
drive along two hotels and their parking kissing those cars side
mirrors. And then there 90° turn to be made. I really do not know how I
managed the same. The hotel guy was there to help me but Pamela was
screaming I was maneuvering left, right, front back and what not. Anyway
once crossed that hurdle the parking area was just behind our room.</p><p>Disappointed
so far we just crashed on our bed even without changing our dress. A
long day from morning 4 a.m came to an end finally.</p></div></div></section><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2017-05-31-uttarakhand-prelude/ title="Day 1 - Drive to Mussoorie"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-left" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Previous</a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2017-09-13-day-2-dehradun-haridwar/ title="Day - 2 Dehradun & Haridwar">Next&nbsp;
