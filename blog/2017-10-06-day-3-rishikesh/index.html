weather looked gloomy with an overcast sky as we woke up. We had
breakfast at the hotel and decided to visit Rishikesh today. Again we
headed back the way we came yesterday and after crossing Rajaji National
Park the road divides and one goes towards to Dehradun and one to
Rishikesh. The drive was pleasant, as we opted Laxman Jhula as our
destination google map smartly took us via highway bypassing the main
city.But at the end the roads started to get narrower lucky for us we
found a parking lot packed yet as we early risers ;)</p><p>**
**</p><p>The
weather was little cold compared to the planes of Dehradun with lots of
breeze coming from Ganga. We walked to Laxman Jhula to cross it. Oh boy!
We have no idea what local authority allows two-wheelers, cycle to cross
the hanging bridge which is meant for a pedestrian. And top of it you
even have some cows standing in the middle.</p><p>**
**</p><p>I
am sure the people coming all the from abroad to Rishikesh for peace,
meditation and self-purity do get a complete shock with this madness.
Once crossed the bridge we spent a good amount time seating on a ghat
and enjoying the beauty of Ganga. There were many rafting boats and
other boats with tourists For lunch we decided to try our luck with
Ramana’s Organic Cafe as suggested by Tripadvisor.  We walked the Ganges
to reach and only to realize we are at the back of Raman’s Cafe. The
final part of the backroad was absolutely no road so it involved little
tricky.</p><p>**
**</p><p>The
place is quite interesting. They have on floor seating arrangement. As
there were many kittens I was not comfortable to sit there. So we opted
for the floor above with chair and tables. All the vegetables they
produce at their farm. They are an NGO with a school for village kids
where they are giving education not only with books but with sports and
working small work here and there.there are many expats who are living
for a couple of months all together to help this community and managing
the hospitality part of the center.</p><p>**
**</p><p>As
we settled for lunch with our food came rain drizzle came and forced us
inside. Oh God, it was tough on me <em>I
HATE cats and have fear cats</em>
I do not like them. I suffer from Ailurophobia.
But the truth is the food was delicious which took away a lot of
pressure for me to enjoy the situation.</p><p>**
**</p><p>While
exiting the property we thought we will proper path this time. So we
exited from the front gate but after many twist and turns ended up again
on the back side from we entered.</p><p>**
**</p><p>Walking
back Laxman Jhula we thought of taking a tuk-tuk and visit another ghat
where Ganga Aarti happens. But At The end, we opted to take our car. The
journey was through narrow lanes but being the second day we are getting
used to the same.</p><p></p><p>Reaching Triveni Ghat we were not so impressed and it looked like we had
to kill another 3 to hours. So after a lot of deliberation, we decided
to rush to Haridwar. So we get back to our car and headed to Haridwar.
Google map tried to be funny again and put us through narrow lanes. But
as we had enough time today we did not panic As soon as we parked our
car at the hotel we rushed for Har Ki Pauri. We got a premium location
today but which also means we were facing Sun for a longer time. After 2
hours of waiting the Aarti started and we got an undisturbed view. Of
course, there was some mean last-minute entry who tries every kind of
tricks to squeeze in. So we had to accept that :(</p><p>After Arti I decided to take a dip in Ganga after all. It was an
experience with chilled water and you really need to hold onto the
chains for your own safety. After that, we visited temples nearby.</p><p>We opted to have dinner at Big Ben just opposite Railway station. While
we were waiting we found our rickshaw-puller at the window. I was
not sure why he was there but soon I realized he was there to return the
lens cover of my lens. Sometimes this kind of big acts by our daily hero
puts a smile that no money can buy. But out of my joy, I forgot to take
a selfie with him. </p><p>The delight of yummy food in a comfortable seating with Aircondition was
really worth the value. The place is little expensive in Haridwar
standard but would recommend it any day.</p></div></div></section><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2017-09-13-day-2-dehradun-haridwar/ title="Day 3 - Rishikesh "><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-left" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Previous</a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2018-05-18-north-east-2018-planning/ title="North East 2018 planning ">Next&nbsp;
