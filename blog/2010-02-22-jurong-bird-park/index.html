We decided
to go for <strong>Jurong bird park</strong> and offbeat track -<strong>Kong Meng San Phor
Kark See Monastery</strong>, is the largest monastery in Singapore.</p><p>We had breakfast at ChatterBox as the normal breakfast side was packed.
The menu was quite different  from the normal side as we had lots of
traditional dishes to choose from. As usual Pamela had lots of dim-sum
and I  preferred the usual cereal and fruits.</p><p><a href=../images/2010-02-22-jurong-bird-park-Kong+Meng+San+Phor+Kark+See+Monastery.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2010-02-22-jurong-bird-park-Kong+Meng+San+Phor+Kark+See+Monastery.jpg alt></a></p><p>We started with the monastery, and when Orchard road tourist info office
they were bit of surprised with our choice. The nearest MRT stop is
<strong>Bishan</strong> and from there we took bus no 410. It took around 1 1/2hrs to
complete the same. We enjoyed the serenity of that place painted in
bright colors.</p><p><a href=../images/2010-02-22-jurong-bird-park-Kong+Meng+San+Phor+Kark+See%2528S_A%2529.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2010-02-22-jurong-bird-park-Kong+Meng+San+Phor+Kark+See%2528S_A%2529.jpg alt></a></p><p>From there we went to Jurong bird park via <strong>MRT</strong>. This MRT journey is
very long as covers almost whole Singapore Northern part. On the way we
picked <strong><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zongzi>Zongzi</a> (or zong)</strong>
traditional Chinese food, made of glutinous rice stuffed with different
fillings; we had red bean paste. It is tetrahedral shape and wrapped in
bamboo or reed leaves where leaf imparts its own unique smell and flavor
to the rice. They are cooked by steaming or boiling. After a long wait
got into <strong>194 SBS</strong> bus from <strong>Boonlay</strong> metro station by that the sky
was already dark with afternoon clouds. As soon as we reached park gate
it was almost 4 PM abut luckily rain stopped.</p><p>It is open concept park which houses some thousand birds. We started our
walk from on left side of ticket counter followed by crowned pigeon-
World’s Largest Pigeons. They are at tree-top level with walkway which
offers a completely unobtrusive view of the birds since there are no
wire meshes separating the visitor from the birds. Then they have large
collection of horn-bills and toucans. Lory Loft showcases the Lorykeet
where Visitors can enter, traverse and exit Lory Loft at treetop level,
allowing for a bird eye’s view of the majestic panorama.</p><p>The bird shows at the Pools Amphitheater featuring flamingos, macaws,
hornbills and cockatoos are both spectacular and funny we heard from
others but we couldn&rsquo;t watch any as reached there late afternoon.
African Waterfall Aviary, home to free-flying African birds and parrots
paradise we missed. They have air conditioned panorail system with
stoppages which covers the entire Park providing excellent elevated
views.</p><p>They have birds of prey section too then ostrich, Double-Wattled
Cassowary, Emu followed by Dino Dig which allows children and family
members to experience archaeological diggings together and discover
fossils hidden through time amidst the sands. It is entertaining for
both adults as kids.</p><p>From there we walked towards riverine featuring ducks, fishes and
turtles, swan and pelican cove and then flamingo .Penguin Parade
enclosure, in a re-created Antarctic setting is worth seeing from kids
point of view. Shoe bill, African crane, saddle billed storks and then
at last we entered world of darkness which houses different species of
owl.</p><p><a href=../images/2010-02-22-jurong-bird-park-Crowned+Pigeon.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2010-02-22-jurong-bird-park-Crowned+Pigeon.jpg alt></a></p><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>TIP:</strong> Scrolling around the park would take more than 2-3 hours.
So make sure to come earlier so that you can spend more time
mingling with birds. And one can still have time to relax in one of
their huts while watching the birds and listening to their symphony.
Personally, seen different kinds of birds only in pictures and
books. It really awakens our childhood desires. My son enjoyed a
lot. We had to carry stroller up and down the stairs many a times.
Although it was bit tiring but MUCH better on foot, at our own pace.
Overall, spent fabulous day with birds of different species from
different countries at one place. Best part is the whole area is
very green and serene.</p></blockquote></blockquote><p><a href=../images/2010-02-22-jurong-bird-park-Flamingo.jpg><img src=../images/thumbnails/2010-02-22-jurong-bird-park-Flamingo.jpg alt></a></p><p>They have unique restaurant as all the chairs are made of metal with
different kinds of animal figures. As well one can&rsquo;t miss their souvenir
shop as it is at EXIT door. Instead of wounding up by taking the bus to
MRT we hired a cab for our hotel; got freshened up then left for dinner
at Lau Pa Sat known for satay and stingray under the stars.</p></div></div></section><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2010-02-04-visit-to-hungry-tide-sunderban/ title="Jurong bird park"><span class="icon is-small"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left"></i></span><span>Previous</span></a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2010-02-23-sleepy-monday/ title="Sleepy Monday"><span>Next</span>
