Central Station; bought our ticket for next destination
<strong>“Cinqueterre”</strong> - refers to five small villages <strong>(Corniglia,
Manarola, Monterosso al Mare, Riomaggiore</strong> and <strong>Vernazza)</strong> - cling to
the rugged mountains along Mediterranean coastline with breath taking
view.</p><p>This <strong>UNSECO</strong> heritage site is not on the main train line or motor-way
that connects Milan to Rome. To get there, we have to cross the mountain
to reach the western side of Italy. Need to change train at <strong>Genoa</strong>-
known for its pesto sauce and native place of Columbus. It is said that
as the western side of the <strong>Liguria hills</strong> gets the best sun light
which is perfect for tomato and basil. As we had to change train from
main line to local line we could only get glimpse from train.</p><p>There are special trains from <strong>Levanto to La Spezia</strong> which stops in
these five villages. As I write down about different trains lines I am
sure you got an idea how remote these little villages are ; yes they are
really small villages. Tourist attraction has not yet turned them into
mini town.</p><p>Cost of hotels in those five small villages were enormous so we booked
hotel at Levanto, north of Cinqueterre a small village with sandy beach,
bustling day-time markets. Later, while exchanging travel notes with
friends we found Levanto was a better choice in terms of food, spacious
room and most importantly price and service.</p><p>After checking into the hotel in afternoon we rushed back to the
rail-station to head towards the south most station Riomaggiore. We got
one day <strong>“Cinque Terre Card”</strong> that allowed us to hike and ride public
transport in Cinqueterre. This small amount helps to maintain this
National Park.</p><p>The best way to explore Cinqueterre is to hike the trails between the 5
villages; there are other numerous trail which connects vineyards and
sea. Of course, there are public transport or ferry to hop between
villages.</p><p>We planned to hike south to north in one go; the distance between
<strong>Riomaggiore</strong> to <strong>Monterosso al Mare</strong> is <strong>12kms</strong>, a lot of the
trail is steep and rocky. The hike started with steep stairs leading to
famous <strong>Via dell’Amore</strong>, (which needs no translation I hope - Path of
love). The walk from Riomaggiore to Manarola is the easiest which takes
about 15-20 minutes depending on how long you stop to gaze at the view!
It is paved all the way and fairly flat.</p><p>The next section of the walk is from Manarola to Corniglia ( 3km long
and takes about 1 hour). Parts of this trail are pretty easy, but it is
steeper at times, the ground is sometimes uneven. The most exhausting
part of this section is at the end. As you arrive at Corniglia train
station there are also signs to reach secluded or public beach along the
way. That means you need to hike down to the sea. The station is located
by the sea side, while the town of Corniglia is on top of the hill which
is connected by long flight of stairs!!!</p><p>The section between Corniglia and Vernazza is most scenic part passing
through vineyards, fragrant herb bushes and rocky outcrops with
spectacular views. It took about 1.5 hours to complete, though we
stopped quite a bit to admire the views and took some breathe.</p><p>Toughest section is between Vernazza and Monterosso with lots of ups and
downs and steep stairs. It is a real bridle path which unwinds itself by
the seaside.</p><p>From here, we returned back to Levanto by train full of sun-burned
tourists.</p><blockquote><p><strong>TIP:</strong> Need good pair of shoes to avoid weary legs and hiking pole
will save your knees. We hiked this part in late afternoon as we were
crunched with time but will advice to start in the morning so that you
take more frequent stops to admire the beauty and give rest to your
legs and lungs.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>At the end, we almost had to run as we were not prepared for hiking in
dark and it was only us on that trail. You can spend few days in these
villages to unwind and explore churches and other historic buildings
if those interest you. &lt;/p</p></blockquote></div></div></section><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2007-11-21-milan-and-lake-como/ title="Cinqueterre – Mediterranean nirvana"><span class="icon is-small"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left"></i></span><span>Previous</span></a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2007-11-23-an-afteroon-at-pisa/ title="An afteroon at Pisa"><span>Next</span>
