honest. It was great to watch to few late nights World Cup Football
matches live with Jishu. Saturday went to usual vegetable market at HAL.
After a quick and early lunch we went to southern part of Bangalore to
drop Jishu back home. It started to drizzle at first and very soon it
was pouring by the time we reached <em>BTM</em> layout. The traffic started to
move in snail pace and meanwhile Aaarush dozed off while seating in his
car seat. So from BTM we went to checkout <a href=http://www.oysterbath.com/><strong>Oyster Bath
Concepts</strong></a> at <em>Jaynagar</em> showroom. Luckily
the rain stopped and we left Aarush for 5-10 minutes while sleeping as
car was parked right infront of the showroom. From there wanted to go to
<em>Commercial Street</em> as rain almost stopped. But on the way it again
regained its power and was splashing water all over. So we decided to
keep our feet dry and head towards home. It was a long detour to reach
home to be honest and only person benefited was Aarush as he completed
his afternoon nap. So at the end instead of going directly to home we
went to <strong>Sambitâ€™s</strong> place and had a good time there.</p></div></div></section><div class=container><div class=tabs><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2010-06-24-weekend/ title="Another weekend"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-left" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Previous</a></p><p class=control><a class="button is-light" href=https://santm.com/blog/2010-06-30-progress-new-apartment/ title="Progress @ New Apartment">Next&nbsp;
