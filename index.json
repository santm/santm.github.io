Just realised yesterday when discussing with my son that I did not even stay that long at my parent’s home. Yes it is a blessing in this difficult time.\nAs many of you know my MIL had a bad fall during lockdown and had to go through major operation. We could not arrange a travel pass at that time so when the opportunity came we decided to come to Durg/Bhilai around November 1st week and stay as much we can.\nThe first thing we did was to get a high speed fibre connection. And to our delight the installation was complete within 18 hours of putting my request. Luckily, Diwali being at the corner after that everything almost stopped for a week here.\nWith a good reliable internet connection,wife and son continued their online school from here in the morning and me hogging the bandwidth in the evening. We felt a few times we should get a small UPS to ensure complete uninterrupted connectivity but most of the time power was very stable. Chhattisgarh is an electricity rich state, which means they produce a lot even residents get a 50% discount on their bill thanks to the new government. Personally, I did not like this scheme as it means people will be careless for conserving energy.\nThis trip is most memorable for me as an amateur birder ; went out for bird photography a few times a week. Thanks to social media with few phone calls I was connected with very experienced photographers who knew the Bhilai-Durg area very well. They really took me under their wings and we had lots of fun. I learned a lot from them. As most of our trips started at the wee hours, we watched beautiful sunrises. On our long trips, they used to ensure home cooked breakfast.\nAlso met a few birders from Raipur but only once as after all Durg Raipur is not that near and as there are many options to explore around Durg itself.\nMeet up with a few college friends who are staying around Durg.\nWe went to Bastar which requires another post(s) for itself and a few day trips around Durg.\nBut this stay n Durg will be memorable for my new found birding group. Looking forward to meet them soon.\nHere is the link to the bird photography album\n","excerpt":"2½ months at in-laws' place just went like that, my longest stay away from home.

Aarush, Pamela \u0026amp; Santanu in alphabetical order. We are currently based at Bangalore, India. In past, we lived in Mumbai (Bombay), Paris and Bay-Area (SFO).\nWe like to travel, make new friends and explore and understand diversity and cultures at its best. We try to do that along with day jobs. Check out our thousands of photos, travelog, random thoughts and creativity.\nBrief history The domain santm.com is a self sponsored birthday gift :) Registered the domain back on Friday the 13th of 2000. Honestly I did not know about paraskevidekatriaphobia or triskaidekaphobia those days it was just a weekend for me.\nThe website was initially hosted on Yahoo!\u0026rsquo;s(Lycos) free hosting called Tripod with static pages. Moved on to shared hosting as creating static page was no fun. You have to track every small changes and I was not using any framework for that in those days. Started few small php pages but after that it was with WordPress for a while. Those shared hosting was always slow as never spent too much on the personal hosting. Neither this sites see too many traffics where it can be self-funded by Ads money. Anyway who likes Ads :(\nMoved Google\u0026rsquo;s blogspot with custom domain. While it is a great tool for blogging the template choices are very limited and can never trust those free templates with many hidden codes.\nNow back to static hosting with Hugo. The theme is a simple, minimalistic \u0026amp; responsive build on Bulma framework made by me. The hosting now moved to GitHub pages.\nWith rise of social media connecting with friends and family is very easy and the blog section show drastic reduction. Hope to write up the travel diaries as much as we can.\nThere are lots of challenge in migrating services and that always causes many part of the website not to be perfect. But this gives me real life problem to be solved. I learned a lot in the that process.\n","excerpt":"Quick Intro This is an about page for Misra Family.

I know it sounds oxymoron but trust me when you are on the road for some time you need a day or two just doing nothing. Majuli was supposed to a magical place for us.\nAs we drove back west from Sivsagar we took the diversion to Nematighat, the boat embarkation point (ferry ghat) to go to Majuli. In recent times Majuli has lost its size due to many floods but it still holds the record for the largest river island.\nWe thought the drive from the highway to the ferry point would be quick, but it was a long one. The last 2 KM we drove on the bank of the river Brahmaputra and it was fine white sand all over. Even though we were not driving at very fast speed there was a sand storm on our back. As we approached the ferry we queued up for the cars to be placed on the next boat.\nNow, these are small boats which carry passengers, bikes and cars. But space for a car is limited and if the boat is even smaller it could be only 2 cars at a time. Lucky for us the car in front of us broke down, they were trying their best to put that car. But Pamela smartly managed the situation and said if they are having so much tough time putting the car on the boat how they will get it out on the other side? Now putting up the car on the boat is not easy, we deftly drove the car down the slushy, scary-steep incline and stopped at the edge of a makeshift jetty on the river and there two wooden planks, almost as narrow as the tires, between the jetty and a country boat. But those guys were extra helpful as they realized we are a tourist. The cars are parked next to each other barely a few inches gap between them and it seems it is norm to keep the car door unlocked.\nThe seating space was very packed as well many travelers were on the top of the roof which provides better ventilation, but it was noon and we opted out of it. The boat ride is about an hour plus and there was an intermediate stop before Majuli. Once we landed in Majuli and got our car out we waited for the other cars and local taxi/tempos and we started towards our hotel.\nMajuli welcomes us with its rustic beauty. There are only a few major roads that connect within the island. We stopped at Ural restaurant we found along the road and simple rice plate in the Assamese style.\nOur stay was at Deka Chang, the place is supposed to be one of the best ones in Majuli. It even gets featured in the Priyanka Chopra’s promo video of Assam tourism. We got ourselves a very big room which was not needed. But it was due to the fact some government official was staying while he was on official vacation. This stay of the official caused us very poor service. And we were disappointed and cursing ourselves for choosing this property.\nIn the evening we visited the nearby temple (Satra). This Satra is very special as it runs by family members. It is called Garamur Satra. Satras are Vaishnav temple and they are very special to Assam’s history and culture. Just to highlight few facts about Majuli\n The first newspaper of Assam was published here. Sankaradeva established the first Satra here. Here you will find the largest tribal community of Assam the Misings. Even though there all religious people stay on this island there is no mosque. It is just to show respect and great community living. After observing the evening prayer at the Satra we had dinner at the same place where we had lunch and called it a day.\n","excerpt":"Somewhere on the internet once read the need for a vacation within a vacation.

Later, in the final planning stage realized it was too long of a drive. Covering Guwahati, Shillong \u0026amp; Dibrugarh was getting too much in one trip so saved it for a later day. Sivasagar remained in the itinerary for a night stay with a condition if we finish Gibbon-Hollongapar and still have time to explore the ancient capital of the Ahom kingdom. As we had good sightings in the morning at Hollongapar we decided to move on and explore the Sivasagar area. The hotel Mr. Barua (Wild Grass) recommended was Hotel Brahmaputra. This hotel is near ONGC complex in the town center. We found the hotel room to be OK/OK for a night stay and checked in. He had an early lunch and wanted to explore as much possible of those historical sites. We decided to cover the distance one first and do the close-by the next day and head out to Majuli. We started with Charaideo Maidams, which is around 30 KM away from the town. The drive was not great as road conditions were bad and we had to navigate big potholes. It took us some time to reach Charaideo. The approach to the site was very nice with canopy cover from the trees. According to history books, it was the first capital of the Ahom kingdom. Now for the Maidams which looks like a small pyramid here are some details below.\nMaidams – *These lofty maidams are the burial mounds of the Ahom kings and nobles. The Ahom followed an unique mortuary practice to bury their dead kings and nobles in the coffin and an earthen mound of pyramidal shape raised over it. These maidams are hemispherical in shapes ad vary in sizes depending upon the power and status of the buried individual. The hemispherical mound is usually bound by an octagonal enclosure wall with an entrance on the western side and at the top of the mound generally occurs a brick-built structure.\nThe picturesque forest setting makes this place very ideal for leisure walks with a cool breeze. The Ahom’s continued to bury their royalty here long after they moved their capital elsewhere, and the mounds are still considered sacred. On our way back from Charaideo we stopped at Kareng Ghar (at Garhgaon) which is around 15 KM away from the town. This brick palace is the last major remnant of the Ahom kingdom’s before they moved their capital to Sivasagar. This is a stepped pyramid-style structure with 4 floors. The top floor has a dome-like roof with a hamber. Kareng Ghar was built first in 1540 but 1752 the current structure was built on the top of the old one as the old one worn out over time. The influence of contemporary Mughals can be seen in the structure. There are four main gates to the palace. It is believed there is a secret tunnel from Kareng Ghar to Talatal Ghar (15 KM). After taking lots of pictures in their well-maintained garden we decided to head back to the town. We parked our car next to the district court and explored Sivasagar Tank and temples around its famous Shiv Dol, Vishnu Dol \u0026amp; Devi Dol. These three temples are next to each other. Shiva Dol is the tallest, Vishu Dol has finer workmanship. Some might say these temples resemble the famous Kamakhya temple of Guwahati. These temples were built by the Ahom queen Phuleswari. As the sun was setting down we got some great shots of these temples in golden light. We walked on the tank bank and reached the Assam Tourism hotel which is one of the corners of the Tank. We had an early dinner called it a day.\nThe next day, early morning without any breakfast and all we started for the remaining attractions. We started with Joy Sagar Tank another massive man-made water body. It is Asia’s biggest man-made tank.The Sivasagar college was next to it. We wanted to drive along the complete perimeter, but one side is blocked by the Indian Army. I respect a lot Indian Army for their sacrifice and hard work but it is strange how they occupy some central part of a town and causes hindrance to civilian. We came to Talatal Ghar next, founded by King Rudra Singha. Built-in the 1750s over an earlier wooden palace, it originally had seven stories, three of which were underground (including secret escape tunnels). Now we can visit the two surviving above-ground levels, which have labyrinthine galleries and a large flat roof holding several pavilions. From there we went to the last attraction Rang Ghar passing Gola Ghar(Amination Storage). And It the best attraction to the Sivasagar area to me. It is a two-story, oval-shaped pavilion built by King Pramatta Singha in 1746. We walked up to the top floor, from where the royalty watched buffalo and elephant fights and other entertainment. The place was under renovation when we visited. The place used to come alive during Bihu festivals. After this, we had breakfast on the way back to the hotel and left for Majuli.\n","excerpt":"When I was planning this long trip to Assam I always wanted to drive all the way up to Dibrugarh where I studied till class 5.

Still, after so many months, it remains clear like yesterday. We slept early knowing we have to leave early. So when the alarm went off at 4 AM the whole place was quiet and dark. We hauled all our luggage from the room to the rented car. It was a bit of a task given that we were staying backside of the property. Any way by 4:30 we started and headed east to Hollongapar GIBBON.\nThe traffic was thin as there was not much movement in the early morning. Soon the sun came out, but the road condition started to deteriorate with ongoing road widening and other work. We passed many tea gardens on both sides of the national highway. But suddenly we saw one accident and lots of people. As we approach slowly we saw the accident involved a truck carrying fresh fish and another vehicle. As the fishes would spoil every villager was carrying two-three big fishes in their hand or any makeshift begs that they could find. It was quite a scene. I am sure those villagers even might remember that day when they had a Fete 😊\nSoon we crossed Jorhat and saw the sign for Mazuli (our later destination). We were following Google Maps and soon we were in the middle of a tea garden as we left the highway behind. We were a little puzzled as there was no mention of crossing a tea garden when we discussed the road condition previous night with Wild Grass Manager. As we had no choice we continued driving and soon we reached a spot where there was a small signboard which said Hollong. But by now the road condition is just dirt track and with previous night rain, it was only suitable for a 4x4. Our rental car was the cheapest one a small Ford Figo. There was no place to take u-turn as the road was narrow and we were moving forward at a snail pace using the tire marks from other cars. We saw only 3 people on this road who were on bicycles collecting fallen woods from the forest. With my broken Assamese, I just managed to ask where is Hollong/Gibbon and they just showed with their hand go forward. Aarush was sleeping in the back seat and we were scared as there was no mobile signal and we realized we are middle of the jungle. After driving for quite a few KMs we reached a spot where we saw forest personal. They gave us a strange look as we were not the locals and had no local guides with us and how we reached there from the wrong road. Talking to them it became aparent that (thanks to Google Maps) we drove through the jungle itself which is not at all sensible as there are wild elephants who are active in the early morning. The forest personnel asked us to pay a minimal fee and told one guard will come with us and it is a walking tour. This was our first walking tour inside a forest where there are wild animals like elephants and leopard. Luckily we got some company of another tourist who came with Diganta Gogoi. Mr. Gogoi runs a homestay and the best guide for Hollong and surrounding areas. Now there are two guards allocated for 6 of us, and they were carrying very old guns on their shoulders. The purpose of those guns maybe just to scare away any animals. I thought we will just go inside for a few hundred meters and come back. And after the scary drive was bit disoriented so when Aarush asked which shoes to put I said just put crocs. But he somehow decided to put proper shoes. As soon as I entered I saw a bright bird and clicked it. And to my surprise, it was Red Trogon and soon the trogon flew away without giving any chance of a second shot. There are only three types of trogon in India, two are found in North East Red-Headed and Ward Trogon. And Malabar Trogon in the Western Ghats. Soon we started to spot the primates we saw Gibbon, Pig-tailed Macaque, Stump-tailed Macaque. Other primates found in the same forest are *Capped Langur, Assamese Macaque, Rhesus Macaque and the only nocturnal primatein the north-east, the **Bengal Slow Loris. ***\nGroup of Stump-Tailed Macaque crossed just in front of us, but my bad luck I ran out of battery. And in the morning with all excitement from the crazy driving, I completely forgot to put the spare battery in my pocket. Asrush got 4 leech bites but he was brave enough not to make any noise. After a few hours of jungle safari on our foot, we turned back to the car. We had a quick chat with Mr. Gogoi and he invited us to stay next time in his homestay which we are looking forward, And this time with proper direction from the forest guide took the road to Jorhat our next destination.\n","excerpt":"Our trip to Hollong was one of the most challenging and memorable ones.

Actually, it is the oldest miscellaneous plantation having Dipterocarpus and Mesua as dominant species It was declared a Reserve by the British way back in 1881, (53years after the advent of British rule) The original forests used to extend to the foothills of the Patkai mountain range. Since then, the forest has been cleared mainly for tea growing by the British. In the 1960s people from Majuli were settled here, so small villages have come up also. Now it is a small tropical wet forest 20 sq km in size.\nThe place is easily accessible and has 7 species of primates. Only walks are allowed and Hollock Gibbon easily sighted. The area has Northeastern India\u0026rsquo;s only nocturnal primate – the slow loris But you have to be overnight in Gibbon itself to see the slow loris. The accommodation is basic inside Gibbon. (night visit is now banned) There is a presence of pigtailed and stump-tailed macaque which can be sighted with moderate luck. In winter (starting late October) it is good for forest birds several species of forest butterflies and giant squirrel also can be seen. The dense forest makes it difficult to see too many birds. Guides claim that in the main road cutting through this small sanctuary more than 100 species of butterflies can be identified in the months of Oct and November as also in March-April.\nThough a plantation it looks like a natural forest with all stories of canopy extant. It’s a natural-looking rain forest and surely worth a visit. The sanctuary is now insular and has no connectivity with a larger forest belt. But earlier it had contiguity with Disoi Valley Reserved Forests(RF) Disoi RF, Tiru RF and Geleki RF bordering Nagaland and was the natural abode of all these primates. Due to large scale human-induced degradation especially from Nagaland the Gibbon Sanctuary is what is left. A pocket herd of the elephant is largely resident in this sanctuary and leopards are also found. Sighting of the groups of primates requires prior arrangement with forest authorities. in this unique forest, It is the best place for orienting a naturalist to the representative rain forest habitat condition coupled with interesting primate sighting especially the Hollock Gibbon which is the only ape available in India. Photographers usually try their luck.\nIt does not take long to explore Gibbon usually people do it ex-Kaziranga they take a hired vehicle to go to Gibbon WLS and leave very early 4 am so they reach the place 128 km (2 and half hours) and then Gibbon activity is over they come back to visit Eastern Range in Kaziranga on same day. The place is 30 odd minutes from Jorhat airport and so on the last day of the tour, it is fruitful to visit this very small sanctuary for those flying out via Jorhat airport. Jorhat airport is 90 km away.\n","excerpt":"Hollongapar GIBBON WILDLIFE SANCTUARY Hollong - the state tree of Aaasm.

For the second day in Kaziranga, we supposed to have Elephants Safari in the morning. Now there are 2 places where you can have elephant safari. The central zone is very popular, is difficult to get, The counter opens at 7 PM in the evening prior and people line up for long, there is a priority to foreign tourist. Our hotel arranged for the Western Zone.\nAs last evening we already had done our safari there, we drove in our car till the Western Gate. Reaching there we called the person who was supposed to make our booking and take us to Safari. There were hundreds of people in the early morning. We could not get the first batch of Safari as there are a limited number of elephants. There were vendors selling hot tea and other hot beverages. We spotted many birds just outside the Park gate.\nThese elephant rides take place at the very edge of the Park. There are only 4 people (max) allowed on each elephant. Depending on the group of tourists and their overall weight distribution the seating is arranged. Getting up on the back elephant is always fun, it is shaky and you need to adjust yourself and your legs properly. The best part of the elephant ride is it takes you very close to the rhino. The track is partly swap so you swing a lot from the back of the elephant. Photography is difficult as there are not many stable moments. The whole ride was for about 45 minutes.\nPost the ride we came back to the hotel, had a big breakfast that involved freshly cooked many dishes. We walked around the property and did some photoshoots. And decided to visit the nearby Orchid \u0026amp; Biodiversity Park.\nIn the afternoon we had our second jeep safari in the central zone. We again saw many birds, elephants, rhino. It was really great. If you plan to visit Kaziranga must recommend Wild Grass for their rustic bungalow with warm hospitality.\n","excerpt":"Our hotel Wild Grass was next to Central Zone.

It has three prominent zones - Central, Western and Eastern.\nCentral Range This drive covers the central region of the park. It is an ideal introduction to the park and its ecology as the route passes through the entire spectrum of habitat types prevalent in the Kaziranga area. (though Brahmaputra view is not available, a stretch of the route goes by the tributary river Difloo) There is a possibility of sighting elephants as well as the other big animals especially the swamp buffalo and of course the rhino. In the extensive short grass yards next to the wetlands the rare Swamp Deer. Swamp Deer is more endangered than the Asian one-horned rhino as far as the world population is concerned.Birding is possible in a wide range of habitats.\nWestern Range From Wild Grass, it takes 20 minutes by jeep to reach the entrance of this Range. The route traverses the southwest portion of the park. This range has maximum short grass areas and is the optimum habitat for Rhino and Water buffaloes The Dunga Tower presents a panorama of short grass edged wetland, patches of tall grassland and woodland in with such visual setting animals can be sighted in a landscape representing their appropriate habitat. Part of the drive is also through Low Alluvial Savannah Woodland. Colonization of grassland by Lagerstroemia trees can be seen.\nEastern (Agaratuli) Range Situated towards the eastern part of the park, less frequented (we did not go there ourselves). The area is excellent for birding. Many water birds can be observed at Sohola Beel. Various woodland birds can be seen along the drive through very scenic Dillenia Swamp Forest. Elephants may be encountered, as well as Water Buffalo and Swamp Deer. Takes 30 minutes to reach from Wild Grass. Part of the route gives an idea of the Brahmaputra river (only tourist route that goes partly by the river). One can do a boat ride in the northeastern point of the Park.\nThe Kaziranga National Orchid \u0026amp; Biodiversity Park Durgapur village off the National Highway(37) itself. It offers a very benign recreational activity. It is about 3 km of walkable distance from Wild Grass. Besides the outdoor Orchids, the greenhouse is manned by personnel adept at orienting and interpreting the rare orchids of NE region The Park has a large array of medicinal plants as also varied species of bamboo groves. A day-long cultural program makes the place lively and a selection of folk dances of different communitiesand tribes of the hills and valley of Assam is continually performed. The Bamboo dance is very special. Ethnic thali having as much as 18 to 26 food itemsis available for lunch and early dinner. There are other exhibit areas apart from the orchid display areas in this property.\nApart from the photo gallery of orchids, the exhibit areas are all evolving into a storehouse of the tangible folk cultural properties of the various communities of Assam. Diverse implements produced out of the necessities of the everyday daily life of the peasants and farmers of different regions of the Brahmaputra Valley help any visitor to understand the material folk cultural forms of the Assam area.\nBurrapahar Wildlife Range, Ghorakati This area is part of the addition to Kaziranga National Park. Scrubland some forty years ago it was under afforestation management practice for fast-growing tree plantation but the low lying areas (now grassland ) were found uneconomical for tree planting. Part of this Range has areas having ideal wet grassland habitat attributes for transient animals from Kaziranga National Park. Kaziranga management was In a search of more areas for the ecological integrity of Kaziranga NP and with this in view the Ghorakati area, as well as the hilly Kukrakata Reserve Forest, has been annexed to Kaziranga. And only a little over a decade ago has been pened to visitors. Again we have not visited this part ourselves.","excerpt":"Kaziranga is one of the bigger National Park of India.

Without much delay, we put all our stuff in the car and head out of the resort for Kaziranga. The best thing about the resort for us its proximity to the highway. We drive on the straight highway going east. The road was divided four lanes and there was not much traffic and was cruising around 100KM/Hr. We crossed Pobitora wildlife sanctuary just outside Guwahati.\nWe even kept a half day back up to visit Pobitora if we do not get to see much in Kaziranga. We were getting hungry as last night the dinner was quite early and did not even had tea/coffee before leaving the resort. As we look out for a decent place to stop for breakfast we reached Anuraag Dhaba near Nagaon bypass.\nWe ordered two plates of breakfast. The dish was served in an authentic Bronze plate with lots of different vegetables. The staffs were wearing traditional Assamese Mekhela Chadar. We were quite impressed with the food and service. The food was served in a very satisfactory manner and the taste was splendid. Overall, we really had a \u0026ldquo;something special\u0026rdquo; kind of experience. Please do not keep your hope too high after all it is a simple place to eat on a highway, but would recommend it for sure.\nNow, as soon as we crossed Nagaon the road condition deteriorated. There was work going on to make four lanes which we are back to 2 lanes road and have to navigate traffic with aution. As we left GHY early we had plenty of time in our hand for the afternoon safari which we had planned. Now we had to cross the Western and Central Zone gate of Kaziranga before reaching our destination “Wild Grass”. As we approach the turn to be taken as suggested by Google map I find a small road going inside from the highway. I did not take that road as there was no sign or anything for Wild Grass. After going 100 meters or so I ask someone local and he points back to the same road. So reluctantly I took the road which is a narrow road with stones and you see bamboo houses, some small plantation and drive like that for a 1KM. We continue and at last, there is a sign for “Wild Grass” a small one on the fork. But as we approach the property we just get mesmerized. It is an old colonial style big bungalow. We were greeted by a warm welcome and were told we have good 2/3 hours before the safari so we can just linger around have lunch and then head out for afternoon safari.\nThe lunch was an authentic Assamese one This place is unique and the owner is the best. He was instrumental in planning this trip. He shared so many details about Kaziranga that no guidebook could have covered it better. Soon we started for our first safari to the West Zone, in fact, we have crossed this gate while coming from Guwahati. It is almost 20/25 minutes drive Wild Grass. Once we reached the gate we had to buy tickets and pay the camera fee and all.\nWe were fortunate enough to spot the one-horned rhino. We spotted elephants and spotted deers. There were many birds but as a beginner, we were not very well versed with the same. We saw an Indian Roller from a close distance. Spotted Pallas Fish Eagle, Lesser Adjutant, Ruddy Shelduck, Pied Kingfisher, and others.\nKaziranga has very tall grass so animal sighting is mainly near the edge of wetlands and in short grass areas. Technically Swamp Deer is more endangered than the Asian one-horned rhino as far as the world population is concerned. We headed back to the resort as the sun sets in the east, the hotel had warm snacks and tea. And once again the dinner was fabulous.\nWe felt like we accomplished all we had to do in Kaziranga ;) but honestly, as I write this post after so many months I find myself reliving each moment once again and wish we could have stayed there for long.\n Kaziranga has very tall grass so animal sighting is mainly near the edge of wetlands and in short grass areas.\n ","excerpt":"After a good night sleep with thunders and rain, the morning was clear of rain but the sky had overcast.

The sky was cloudy but not raining. The 16KM drive is a long one from the resort we stayed and the road of first 8 KM closer to the resort was really bad.\nWe started with Thangkharang Park which looked farthest on the map. The road was good for the most part but again the last 4/5 KM was under heavy construction. Our legs were heavy from yesterday’s hike still we walked around the whole park. We got to see Kynrem falls from there. And Bangladesh plain was in plain sight. The water was not so heavy in Kynrem falls as we were just before the monsoon. I am sure in monsoonthe sight will be completely different with roaring water rushing down the hill. The waterfall is made of three or four stages as you can see from the picture. We could see one or two cars on the winding road and there were a few tourists we went to the base of the falls.\nFrom the park, we headed towards Pillar Rock/Khoh Ramhah but there was no other soul out there. There was no board explaining what we really need to see. So we felt a little disappointed and just circle back from there.\nOn the way back to Sohra we first went to Mawsmai Cave, this is a small cave compared to our very own Belum Caves in Andhra Pradesh. But as usual, the cave had its own fun. Some passages were really small and narrow. And you need to be mindful of your steps all the time as there was water. We were followed by a big Bengali group and they were very noisy which really spoiled the fun. Being a Bengali, we really feel ashamed by these large noisy tourists at times.\nAnyway as we came out and was looking for some biscuits and snacks from the back the car we realized we left our shoe bag at the resort. We called the resort and they informed yes it was left just out of our door and they have kept it safe. After a quick stop at the Monoliths which are on the road itself, we headed back to resort again. We did not stop at Eco-Park and the viewpoint. The drive of 16KM back and forth with the broken and twisted road cost us an hour plus.\nAfter picking up the shoe bag we headed towards Nohkalikai Waterfalls. The road is splendid, we stopped many times, we tried the most difficult form of photography aka landscape with little success.\nThere were lots of spices, pickles and local handicrafts being sold at the viewpoint. After Nohkalikai falls we headed back to the Sohra again and stopped at Ram Krishna Mission. This is very close to the ground where my Shillong-Cherrapunji Marathon ended 2+ years back. This RK Mission played a big role in Meghalaya’s modern history. There is a museum on the first floor highlighting Meghalaya and NorthEast as a whole.\nAfter RK mission we decided to head back to GHY post lunch. We stopped at the Orange Roots a vegetarian restaurant on the highway very crowded. The food was fresh and hot and it was clean.\nAs we approached Shillong we thought of visiting Shillong Peak and drove all the way to the Air Force base to get the ticket when we realized we missed the cutoff. Disappointed we headed back to the highway. The road was narrow and had to manage big construction trucks on the turns and twist which was a complete waste. And top of that the weather was perfect with late afternoon sun on a clear blue sky ☹\nWe spoke with our hotel owner in Kaziranga and he was saying if you really want ride a little longer from GHY and next 4/5 hours you will be there. While it sounded promising we were not ready for that long drive.\nAlternately he suggested stopping near GHY where there are lots of new resorts. We found it was way cheaper to book via MakeMyTrip so we booked online and headed toward GHY. We were going to stay at Brahmaputra Jungle Resort. Lucky for us we did not face major traffic while getting out of Shillong it was snail pace but moving. It did take a long time to get out from one end to the other of Shillong, We could see the long queue of cars/bus/trucks getting towards Shillong. We did stop for few minutes at Badapani/ Umiam Lake but no great sunsets. This time we are cautious and did not miss on JAVA VEG for our break. We had a good break there and almost had our early dinner and headed towards our night stop.\nBy the time we reached the resort we were really tired after so many tourist places and driving. After we finished taking a hot shower and all it started to rain. And it did rain like cats and dogs for a long time. We were lucky that we did not need any room service as there was no chance for those hotel guys to serve us in the rain. And this place is a resort the place we were staying and the dining area was quite far.\n","excerpt":"As usual, the sun went up early as we are the Eastern part of India, so after a good breakfast and settling our bills we left towards Cherrpunjee.

Had breakfast and left the hotel around 9 AM. There are some journeys in life which are hard to forget. Our trek to the much talked about Double Decker Root Bridge was one such journey for me. Staying at Cheerapunji Holiday resort has one advantage that it is hardly 7 km away from double-decker root bridge. We went 5 KM till Tyrna village where we parked our car and then 3KMs of hiking we were told by hotel people. When we asked for a guide they said it\u0026rsquo;s not required, moreover its all marked and proper cemented pathway so no chance of getting lost.\nIt was a 3500 step journey down the hill. After almost 40 minutes we reached a small village which we thought was the village with the bridge, but it was another 40 min from there. At this point, we saw a very small board nailed to a tree indicating the way to the longest root bridge. We were only people there still we wanted to cross that bridge but it shakes and swings and the water flowing 20-25 feet below makes the whole experience breathtaking. I took the courage first to cross but half away, came back felt like can’t cross, then Aarush said mamma, are you scared\u0026hellip;let me go. Then his dad stopped him saying let me go, once I reach another end then you come. Aarush agreed to the same. But halfway through even Santanu came back saying does not look to be safe enough to cross. Then after few photo shoots we returned to a regular path and now the descend was further steep.\nAfter descending few steps, we came across two hanging bridges over rivers. The bridges were made of rusty iron cables repaired and supported with bamboo with some parts held together with steel wires. The whole bridge shakes and swings and the water flowing 20-25 feet below makes the whole experience scary though adventurous. There were 2 families after us\u0026hellip;we allowed them to cross the bridge first. While crossing the bridge all we could hear were the sounds of the squeaking cables and gurgling water flowing down the huge rocks, makes the whole experience nerve-wracking.\nAfter a few more climbing up and down the steps, we reached the new bridge which looks to be recently done. Further few meters ahead was Nongriat village, where they sell some basic food items, juice, water.\nTo reach the double-decker bridge, you have to take a few more steps up – and there it was … This bridge is unique in so many ways. It has been built using the roots of a tree – that’s still alive. It took years to build this bridge – patiently waiting for the roots to be guided over and across the river until it was firm enough to carry weight. Currently, there are two levels of roots that have been guided across, stacked on top of other.\nThese are roots from the rubber tree, which is considered to be 200 yrs old.\nOn reaching there, waterfall from the rocks is so soothing and cool that feel like jumping into the water which we did not but definitely soake my feet in them. Took a few pictures, and spent some time admiring nature\u0026rsquo;s beauty. From here we went towards natural swimming pool asking few villagers on the way. We went further up and down the steps but at one point we were clueless as there was no proper demarcation and that bridge ends abruptly giving no hint for a natural swimming pool. So, after that point, we had to return as there was none to guide further and thus we started our return journey.\nWe again now crossed the double-decker bridge and to my surprise, there was a guest house with minimum facilities for Rs.400/ per day which I came to know on asking one foreigner descending from one corner. On our return, we had some juices to hydrate ourselves while Aarush had proper basic food without any fuss.\nWe started our climb back to Tyrna again through the swinging bridges and those steps. But it did take much more time and effort as though looking at the steep steps. I particularly huffed and puffed to reach the top and in between, it started raining like cats and dogs for few mins. One side it rained and another side we were sweating like pig from head to toe. Felt like they should have one waterfall at the top too so that one can shower there.\n TIPS\n carry a bottle of water and refill in taps they are all potable and drink in sips carry as little as possible – There are some small shops near your destination where you can buy water and snack on some food before you return. Carry cash(no cards) Carry swimming trunks if you want to take a dip in the water pool under the double-decker root bridge and perhaps a cloth to dry yourself out. Change room is available there. Wear comfortable shoes. Wear light clothes preferable shorts but no jeans. ","excerpt":"Today we got up pretty late compared to other days. Had breakfast and left the hotel around 9 AM.

We got up around 6 AM and moved out of the place before 7 AM so as to avoid school traffic. We headed towards Elephant caves which come on the way to Cherrapunji, before that we saw the sign for Shillong Peak. And the sun was perfect to see the entire Shillong from the peak but as we approached near the turning and asked one passer-by whether it will be open. He smiled and said not before 9 AM so we proceeded towards Elephant Caves. Before this comes one famous eatery ML-05 Cafe (ML 05 is Shillog\u0026rsquo;s Vehicle Registration Code). This café is located near the Eastern Air Command in Shillong which was highly recommended last night but unfortunately, it was closed when we were crossing it.\nAnyways, early birds have to face some issues too and does not gets its worm ;) On reaching “V” junction, one road goes to Cherrapunji and Dawki while other to Mawphlang and Mawsynram. And at that junction is the Elephant Falls.\nThis fall is 3 layers fall accessible to all but the point is when we reached there it just opened. We were the first ones to enter there as tourists. The first of the three waterfalls are tucked between the dense trees and are very broad. The second waterfall reduces to thin strands of water while the third and the most visible waterfall is with clear water flowing like a sheet of milk on the dark rocks in the backdrop.\nOut of the three, the third waterfall tends the most impressive. We did our photo session and then on our return to have something for breakfast. But hardly anything was available, they were just setting up their shop. So, Aarush had his cup noodle and Santanu his tea and we took some tetra pack juice for the road.\nWe headed towards Mawphlang sacred grove which is around 25 KMs from here. This was not there in our to-see list but got added last night on the commendation. It\u0026rsquo;s a small forest with meadows around. Khasi people believe it as God and anything was taken out of this forest will bring ill-luck to the person. Perhaps, with that thought, they are able to save this dense forest where one can trek for either 3 or 5 KM with a local guide. The time we reached it started to drizzle and we took one young guide who can speak fluent English.\nThey have been protected by communities for a variety of reasons, including religious practices, burial grounds, and sacrifices. There was no formal entry gate of the kind we usually have at sanctuaries and national parks. We just blindly followed our guide which was nothing more than a usual spacing between trees. Once you are inside its trees, trees, and trees all around- a visual treat to eyes for the people coming from the concrete jungle.\nWe walked on a multi-layered carpet of leaves, twigs, branches, fruits, and ferns. The older trunks had fallen gracefully after a full, long and prosperous life was providing a home to Lichens and mosses and ferns. We felt like walking through the rainforest. Seems like sun needs to seek permission to enter into their dense world. Our guide asked Aarush to try a Mowgli swing on low hanging branches.\nKhasis believe that guardian spirit resides in the forest in two forms-tiger and snake who takes care of this forest. The good spirit appears in the form of a tiger and anything bad as a revengeful snake. Our guide showed us rudraksha fallen from the tree and various type of mushroom and ferns that have grown there. There was a stream flowing in one part of the forest. It\u0026rsquo;s something you see every hues and shade of green there. When we were inside we hardly got any raindrop on us because of dense forests that act as a natural umbrella but as we headed out of the forest we saw it was raining pretty heavily.\nWe got into our car and moved out of this place as we had to go Dawki - Which means we need to come to that V junction and now take the other route. In that way, we stopped for having brunch at a small place. This road is very scenic with mountains and hills, you can see white cotton-clouds looming in between. Indeed, we were amazed by the quality of the roads, and the road to Dawki is the idyllic hill drive (till last 5 KMs before it starts showing wear and tear due to heavy vehicles). At first, I thought this was the result of tourism but later learned that this had more to do with the area’s economic importance of the limestone and coal mines.  Some beautiful paths can’t be discovered without self driving or getting lost.\n The cool, wet airbrushes over your face and lush greenery around refreshes and revitalizes you as it enters your body. Dawki is a small village and its main attraction is the Umngot River that marks the natural separation between the Khasi and the Jaintia Hills. The river can be crossed by a suspension bridge that connects India to Bangladesh and facilitates trade between the two nations. This place is very famous for the emerald green transparent river which I was excitingly waiting for but due to rains, it was very disappointing. Many people did say that but I was adamant to see through my eyes :)\u0026hellip;.my bad-luck. People take boat rides there in season. We crossed the bridge and went to see Tamabil(Indo-Bangladesh border) where road condition was extremely bad. Big trucks were waiting for their turn in 2-3 lanes leaving only one lane to allow the vehicles to pass-by from either side. We reached near the border, parked our vehicle but on our return, it was almost 1-hour wait as no vehicles were able to move.\nWith great difficulty, we were able to come out of that area and zoomed towards Mawlynnong- the cleanest village in Asia. This part of the drive is again very scenic with the different terrain we first went to skywalk machan at Nohwett. It was altogether different experience climbing the bamboo ladder. From there we can see 6 waterfalls.\nThen came towards Mawlynnong which is also said to be gods own garden. When we reached there it was almost getting dark, we went near the stream gushing down and climbed up to their village which is very neat; avoided their living root bridge as it would turn completely dark. There we had some noodles and hit the road back to Cherrapunji.\nAfter some hour nature starts to hide and seek game with fog and it was dense enough that we could hardly see anything in 10 meters; very poor visibility which is difficult to explain people living in plains. We tried following the tail-light of other vehicles but in vain - could not match up with their speed. Then we decided to maintain our 10-20Km speed by keeping two tires in between the white midline demarcation. Only when any vehicle used to come from the opposite side we use to go to side otherwise back again in the same way. At one point, it was so stressful, that I told Santanu to pull over and move the vehicle off the road; sleep inside the car only rather than taking risk of 3 lives. I really panicked and repented of my decision of going to Dawkii. But now Santanu was quite confident and continued driving at very low speed. At one point we got one cab whom we could follow for last 45 min. and was able to maintain pace with him.  “Driving car at that night was you never see beyond your headlight, but you finish your trip that way”.\n From here Cherrapunji was not far, once entering the city we made a call to hotel people for their direction and requested them to keep dinner ready for 3 of us. (this part had poor connectivity with phones but somehow SMS worked). On reaching their one good thing was fog was not there and the second thing we realized that booking we made in the hotel is further 19 KMs from the city. Around 10 KMs of the road was pretty bad near the hotel. Finally, it was almost 10 PM when we reached the hotel. Stay:- Cherrapunji Holiday Resort. (Breakfast and dinner includedwithin price)\n","excerpt":"Last night could not have proper sleep as in the middle of the night there was a sudden storm, followed by rain and finally power cut off. We got up around 6 AM and moved out of the place before 7 AM so as to avoid school traffic. We headed towards Elephant caves which come on the way to Cherrapunji, before that we saw the sign for Shillong Peak. And the sun was perfect to see the entire Shillong from the peak but as we approached near the turning and asked one passer-by whether it will be open.","ref":"https://santm.com/blog/2018-12-17-day-3-long-day-long-drive-crazy-one-meghalaya/","title":"Driving Khasi Hills, Day-3 -- Assam \u0026 Meghalaya Trip 2018"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/shillong/","title":"Shillong"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/birds/","title":"birds"},{"body":"As we learn more about birds we try to accommodate a day or two within\rour family trips for birding.

We left on a Monday quite unusual day to start a trip, always there is something new to do. We left home at 4:10 AM and b\u0026rsquo;cos of that we had almost zero traffic in crossing Bangalore city and every toll both we did had any queue and by 7:30 we reached Salem and stopped for Breakfast. Post breakfast we had to cross Salem and by 12ish we are in the border of Tamil Nadu \u0026amp; Kerala.\nWe had to drive through Thani, Cumbummettu as direct road to Thekkady via Gudalur was closed from recent rain and flood of Kerala.\nJust before our journey, there was a RED alert for a new cyclone which was later withdrawn but we did get rains first 2 days b\u0026rsquo;cos of that.\nWe stayed in Club Mahindra Thekkady for 3 nights. We did not do any homework before this trip and overreaching there realized all forest walks were off limit for Aarush as he is not yet 12 years old.\nI did one jungle walk the next day (Tuesday) with one guide alone as there no other guests but it was in a way good as he dedicated all his time to spot birds for me. Post that we drove all way to Vagamon (I ran an 80KM Ultra this year) so wanted to show Pamela and Aaarush the scenic Suicide Point. While driving we crossed many tea garden and coffee estate and spice gardens. Evening we saw a Kathakali performance.\nWednesday Morning, we as a family did the boat ride in Periyar and sawmany more birds. But October is not the best season as the best season starts from November to February when many migratory birds also come there. Around noon we drove till Gavi point, but we were the only tourist there so could not do much. That evening for the first time itdid not rain :)\nThursday, we started from Thekkady in the early morning and headed for Munnar to witness Neelakurinji. These wildflowers only come once in 12 years but due to heavy rain the picture perfect moment was not there. But we had to drive again and headed to Thattekad (Salim Ali bird sanctuary). We did a night walk with our guide and spotted Great-eared Nightjar.\nFriday, we did we morning bird watch but rain from the beginning of the week was not helpful as even though the weather was better we could not spot many birds.\nPost birding we decided to move back to Bangalore and started from there around 12 Noon.\nAfter 3 stops along the route, we reached home post-midnight, traffic within Bangalore was not a welcoming one as it took almost an hour to cross (in)famous Madiwala junction.\n","excerpt":"Just back from a week-long trip of Kerala.

This place was in such an area where proper roads were not there….it was full of potholes and filled with rainwater from previous rains. One thing is there Guwahati inner roads are not great and even city is not that clean\u0026hellip;full of plastics. Anyways we zoomed out from that place without much wastage of time and hit the highway.\nWe were recommended to have breakfast on the way at Jiva resort but which we could never find nor even any hoarding-related to that. This Guwahati-Shillong road is very good because of which it hardly took 2-2.5 hrs to reach near Bada Pani (Umiam lake).\nUmiam Lake When we reached it was a clear sky with no sun though. Then we were looking forward to boating area so that we can go near the lake. There was a sign for Umiam lake which we followed and it took us to orchid lake resort and very close to it has a garden with boating area. We decided to have a look at it first and then have breakfast. The moment we reached here, we were followed by some gujju families too\u0026hellip;we did some photo session there. The serene lake is surrounded by thick coniferous forests. One can take a long boat ride in the lake, and adventure lovers can enjoy boating and various water-sports. There are a few islands in the lake that can be used as pit-stops if one requires a moment of rest while boating through the lake.\nWe slowly proceed towards Orchid Lake Resort to have our breakfast. We were offered with buffet breakfast which was 300 INR for adults. Their dining hall has a high ceiling and at the centre, a fireplace for winters or maybe night time. Dining Hall windows face towards lakefront and their garden which is nicely maintained.\nShillong We had our breakfast which was more of brunch and then took a tour of their lake facing the garden and headed straight to Shillong road towards the city. Our Google map guided us to through numerous twists and turns of narrow lanes. On our very fast left turn we too such a narrow cut that felt almost we would topple but the traffic police smiled and signaled us to proceed ahead. it was a scary start for what time coming next as we drive though twisted small roads.\nWe were looking out for Happy-Valley which made us really unhappy at one point of time that we gave up hope but somehow managed to reach army area where we stopped to ask them about the area we were looking for. Phone signal was pretty bad at that moment of time and even when it went the person on other side was not responding so we were not sure to proceed or stop there.\nFor civilians all Assam Regiments look the same, so with a lot of confusion in mind, we went down the hill where it seems there is another base camp which is having the guest room we were looking for. On reaching there, we got the hone signal we were looking forward. Then on entering our next job was to find the guest house but looks like we ended up in some official area which was deserted. After a while, we could locate someone who guided us with one jawan to our room.\nWe were introduced to our room buddy, who was so kind. ”Sir, Would you like to have something for lunch”\nNO (we are too full to have any)\n“Sir, if you have any problem or complaint, related to anything, please first contact me”.\nWe were surprised to hear that but we smiled and replied: “ Don’t worry we are fine.”\nWe were actually taken back to see the room with slipper, comb, razor etc. with a proper kitchen where one can cook too for themselves if needed.\nAs the day became more \u0026amp; more brighter we decided to go for city tour but in meantime, our host called to know our whereabouts and our plan. As we said our plan he proposed to take his army gypsy to police bazar to avoid parking and entry through their gates which will need permission again. By the time he came personally to check if everything was fine with us or not.\nIn the meanwhile, his gypsy came and we left for police bazaar which was as usual crowded. The driver stopped us near the square and asked us to call once done to which we agreed upon. We strolled through the street. From young to old, the woman looks dazzling, dressed in their traditional attire (jainsem), which they pair with matching cardigans and heels. The street was busy with cozy cafes, restaurants and small umbrella shops and varieties of footwear. Side road was busy with their black Maruti 800 cab (public transport).\nWe walked towards Ward’s Lake which is closer to Governor\u0026rsquo;s house. This lake also has a cafeteria and a Botanical Garden, we paid entry fees and then crossed one wooden bridge which takes to another side of the lake. It\u0026rsquo;s nice to watch people boating and feeding fish.\nWe took the privilege of perfect evening sunlight and did time pass photography all over the garden. This garden has a lot to offer in terms of floral bed, bamboo trees and cobbled pathway, nicely manicured plants. As we strolled around, we too started feeling hungry and as the Sun was going further west we decided to move back to police bazar area for some light snacks.\nWent to Grover\u0026rsquo;s eatery, which was right at the corner on the first floor of the shopping complex. It has nice decor tastefully done but takes time for food to reach the table. After having some soups and momos we left from there as we had to go to our host\u0026rsquo;s place for dinner.\nWe had a nice evening with soothing music in the background. Mrs. Nayyar pampered us with an elaborate spread of starters and main course. It was really nice of (colonel) Mr. and Mrs .Nayyar to host us. We deeply appreciate their role and thanks them from bottom of our heart to be part of our memorable journey.\n Stay: At Army Basecamp\n ","excerpt":"We started early morning with a drive to pick-up point of our rented car.

Kamakhya Temple is around 14KM from the airport and our relatives stay on the other side of the city. It makes sense to start the trip in an auspicious way and we tried to strike 2 birds with one.\nOn D-day at the wee hours we three took shower, ensured all right measures were taken from the kitchen to balcony for a long vacation. Pre Booked airport cab was a right choice as last time we did not have so nice experience with Uber/Ola. Morning marathon is sometimes little difficult when you are on vacation but it\u0026rsquo;s all fine when you are bitten by the travel bug.\nAfter security check-in we were seated in the lounge, talking and watching people from different parts of the world and suddenly a call came. After a very short talk, I looked at Santanu in order to know whose call it was at that hour ….\u0026ldquo;Ground Staff \u0026ldquo;calling to board the plane…..quite surprised though. Were we really lost in watching people and do they call personally on the phone, as it\u0026rsquo;s a silence zone\u0026hellip;Strange but feels good.\nOn boarding the flight we met surprisingly one of the friends and his son on the same flight who were supposed to go with us to Shillong initially but had to cancel due to last minute emergency. The father-son duo was going just for a family function. We spoke two words and moved on to our designated seat. After waking up so early, me and my son were really hungry waiting for the breakfast which we have pre-ordered. Santanu was first one and me in between dozed off but my son was completely awake whole of the time.\nIn between, that friend of Santanu came and spoke to us for some time about his family matters and even my son went to talk to his son. On landing, we had a quick selfie and parted our ways. Santanu\u0026rsquo;s cousin was waiting outside for us with his car. Maa Kamakhya Temple which is situated on Nilachal hill and is one of the oldest of the 51 Shakti Pithas. Shakti Peethas are shrines or divine places of the Mother Goddess. These are places have been blessed with the presence of divinity due to the falling of body parts of the corpse of Sati Devi, when Lord Shiva carried it and wandered in sorrow.Now out of 51, 4 are considered Adi(primary ) Shakti Pithas and Kamakhyais one of them. The main temple is a cave of indeterminate age, with rock steps leading down to the garbhagriha. According to Kalika Purana, the site marks the spot where the yoni of the Goddess fell, and the hill turned blue. The deity is represented by a representation of the yoni.\nThe temple has various sculptures around embedded in the walls not only outside but inside also constructed during Aahom rule.\nFrom regular families to politicians, foreign tourists to sadhus and sanyasis, everyone wants to have a darshan. Its really difficult to make your way through a bustling crowd but being a cloudy day with raining lightly it was not crowded madly but enough for you to stand in a long queue.\nOn reaching the top, we were introduced to one known panda(priest) who took care of us. We bought VIP tickets of 500 INR for both and were made to sit in one room. In between and it started to drizzle more. After waiting there for about 40 minutes we were made to join one line from where it takes to the main temple. There are three kinds of queues in Kamakhya - the ordinary one, the VIP one and lastly one for armed forces.\nWe couldn\u0026rsquo;t see much after our offering as it was raining and was getting time for temple closure for bhog (mid-day offering to Goddess). Santanu’s cousin drove us to Bhuvaneshwari temple from where you can view entire Guwahati city and river Brahmaputra on a clear day.\nBut unfortunately, we couldn’t see much because of bad weather. We paid our homage to the temple and quickly moved from there to our relatives' home.\nBy the time we reached was almost 3 PM, had late lunch and catch up with them after long gap about the entire family. In the evening we went to visit another relative who resides close by and had the plan to go for dinner somewhere outside. But relatives seeing us after such long time pampered us to the extent that we were almost full having no space for dinner.\nThen seeing the time and weather we too decided to call off the day so that next morning we can wake up early as well as fresh in order to start our journey by road with our Zoom car.\n","excerpt":"Guwahati Kamakhya The flight to Guwahati was too early in the morning from Bangalore and we decided upon that on landing we will go directly to Kamakhya temple before starting our trip.

In his send-off party, everyone committed that they would like to visit that part of the country. The friend in question is serving our country and he promised to be our host there while we visit Shillong, the Scotland of East and British summer capital of North East.\nOur travel planning started way back in the month of January it was left to Santanu as he grew up in NorthEast to talk to relatives \u0026amp; friends, read travel blogs and come up with a rough itinerary. While initially, he wanted to travel all the way to Dibrugarh, he has fond memories of that places as he studied there between 1st and 4th standard a long long time ago. But he dropped that idea as it would have been too much of traveling. So the first cut and final looked like this. We are really thankful to Mr. Manju Barua (Wild Grass, Kaziranga) for his valuable selfless inputs.\n First Draft What we end up doing Guwahati Guwahati Kaziranga Shillong Gibbon Long Drive And Cherrapunji Majuli Kaziranga (bypassing Guwahati) Nameri Gibbon \u0026amp; Sibsagar Shillong Majuli Cherrapunji Nameri and back to Guwahati It is easy to start and end with Guwahati in NorthEast as it is well connected to rest of India with many flights and trains. To explore and have a relaxing trip we almost decided to have 2 nights halt in most places. The key challenge was rain as Kaziranga closes by end of April. One friend said he would be joining us for Meghalaya part so we changed the first draft and opted to visit Meghalaya first and Assam second. Seeing our detail itinerary many eyebrows were raised. Few of the friends gave up saying they can not have this type of strenuous vacation. Vacation for them is getting up late\u0026hellip;relaxing, enjoying food and not mandatorily visiting all tourist points….aargh just the opposite of our thinking style.\nWe never gave up on our thinking as we are what we are….For us traveling means getting up early, beat the traffic or the other tourists irrespective of breakfast time, cover as many possible, eat foods from roadside small eatery or any recommended place(traditional food) as per convenience. We are so used to all this that my 10 years old also got adjusted to the same. Without complaining, he too enjoys this kind of travel.\n “Once the travel bug bites, there is no looking back we are happily infected till we can”\n Exploring so many places means we need to have a car of our own to travel. We talked to few reliable drivers as suggested by friends and family, their rates were almost similar but was on the higher side for us as we had almost 2 weeks to cover. Moreover, each day we do not plan to travel a lot on the road, so it was more economical to self-drive.\nThere are not many options like other major Metros but ZOOMCAR is there and we made our booking with them in advance.\nAlso, we are used to self-drive as it gives us privacy and the complete back seat to Aarush. He really likes it that way as it gives him liberty to take a small nap in between if needed. Santanu made most hotel booking well in advance, but he kept two buffer days without any prior hotel booking to commodate any unplanned situation.\nWe also planned to visit to Siliguri to visit my mother-in-law for a day and Calcutta for 2 nights on our way back. While we write more on this long trip, please take few minutes off and see this wonderful official video of Assam Tourism.\n","excerpt":"Long prologue … someone once said\u0026hellip;\nHappiness is to plan a trip to somewhere new with your loved one.\n One best friend from Santanu’s engineering college got transferred from Bangalore to Shillong last year.

The drive was pleasant, as we opted Laxman Jhula as our\rdestination google map smartly took us via highway bypassing the main\rcity.But at the end the roads started to get narrower lucky for us we\rfound a parking lot packed yet as we early risers ;)** **\nThe\rweather was little cold compared to the planes of Dehradun with lots of\rbreeze coming from Ganga. We walked to Laxman Jhula to cross it. Oh boy!\rWe have no idea what local authority allows two-wheelers, cycle to cross\rthe hanging bridge which is meant for a pedestrian. And top of it you\reven have some cows standing in the middle. ** **\nI\ram sure the people coming all the from abroad to Rishikesh for peace,\rmeditation and self-purity do get a complete shock with this madness.\rOnce crossed the bridge we spent a good amount time seating on a ghat\rand enjoying the beauty of Ganga. There were many rafting boats and\rother boats with tourists For lunch we decided to try our luck with\rRamana’s Organic Cafe as suggested by Tripadvisor. We walked the Ganges\rto reach and only to realize we are at the back of Raman’s Cafe. The\rfinal part of the backroad was absolutely no road so it involved little\rtricky.** **\nThe\rplace is quite interesting. They have on floor seating arrangement. As\rthere were many kittens I was not comfortable to sit there. So we opted\rfor the floor above with chair and tables. All the vegetables they\rproduce at their farm. They are an NGO with a school for village kids\rwhere they are giving education not only with books but with sports and\rworking small work here and there.there are many expats who are living\rfor a couple of months all together to help this community and managing\rthe hospitality part of the center. ** **\nAs\rwe settled for lunch with our food came rain drizzle came and forced us\rinside. Oh God, it was tough on me I\rHATE cats and have fear catsI do not like them. I suffer from Ailurophobia.But the truth is the food was delicious which took away a lot of\rpressure for me to enjoy the situation.** **\nWhile\rexiting the property we thought we will proper path this time. So we\rexited from the front gate but after many twist and turns ended up again\ron the back side from we entered. ** **\nWalking\rback Laxman Jhula we thought of taking a tuk-tuk and visit another ghat\rwhere Ganga Aarti happens. But At The end, we opted to take our car. The\rjourney was through narrow lanes but being the second day we are getting\rused to the same.Reaching Triveni Ghat we were not so impressed and it looked like we had\rto kill another 3 to hours. So after a lot of deliberation, we decided\rto rush to Haridwar. So we get back to our car and headed to Haridwar.\rGoogle map tried to be funny again and put us through narrow lanes. But\ras we had enough time today we did not panic As soon as we parked our\rcar at the hotel we rushed for Har Ki Pauri. We got a premium location\rtoday but which also means we were facing Sun for a longer time. After 2\rhours of waiting the Aarti started and we got an undisturbed view. Of\rcourse, there was some mean last-minute entry who tries every kind of\rtricks to squeeze in. So we had to accept that :(\nAfter Arti I decided to take a dip in Ganga after all. It was an\rexperience with chilled water and you really need to hold onto the\rchains for your own safety. After that, we visited temples nearby.\nWe opted to have dinner at Big Ben just opposite Railway station. While\rwe were waiting we found our rickshaw-puller at the window. I was\rnot sure why he was there but soon I realized he was there to return the\rlens cover of my lens. Sometimes this kind of big acts by our daily hero\rputs a smile that no money can buy. But out of my joy, I forgot to take\ra selfie with him. The delight of yummy food in a comfortable seating with Aircondition was\rreally worth the value.

But soon we realized we are in a place\rwhich we are very not fond off. May be the Mussoorie did not blink with\rus. After taking shower and getting ready for the day we went up to the\rrestaurant for breakfast. But looked like we were an early riser as\rthere were no one else and the place was not cleaned up for the day. So\rwe out for a stroll.** **\nThe\rbreakfast was quick and we cleared our dues and packed our bags. Now\rgetting the car out was another struggle but with daylight, it was\rlittle it was little easy but still lots of maneuvering. ** **\nWe\rdecided to give Mussorie a complete pass and started for Dehradun. The\rdownhill journey was quite quick. We thought to cover Indian Forest\rResearch Institute first. Somehow we could not follow Google Map’s\rinitial direction so had to go through the city. We saw Ram Krishna\rAshram along the main road itself. ** **\nForest\rResearch Institute is almost 100+ years old Institute set up by the\rBritish to study and preserve diverse forests of India. It is a must\rvisit for anyone. From Wikipedia ** **\nFRI\rDehradun is one of the oldest institutions of its kind and acclaimed the\rworld over. The institute’s history is virtually synonymous with the\revolution and development of scientific forestry, not only in India but\rover the entire sub-continent.\rBuilt on a lush green estate spread over 450 hectares, with the outer\rHimalaya forming its back drop, the institute’s main building is an\rimpressive edifice, marrying Greco-Romanand Colonial\rstylesof architecture, with a plinth area of 2.5 hectares. The building was\rlisted for a time, in the Guinness Book of Records, as the largest\rpurely brick structure in the world. \n** **\nWe\rspent a good amount of time to explore the museum and its different\rsection. It is really vast if you are not a museum person you might get\rbored too quickly with so many exhibits and history.** **\nAfter\rexploring FRI to our heart\u0026rsquo;s content we left for Robber’s cave or\rGuchhupani. The road from FRI to Robber’s cave goes via military area.\rAs we took a wrong turn out of FRI we crossed the main gate of Rashtriya\rIndian Military College another imperial legacy. It was on our list but\rwe could not stop due to high security to take any decent picture of the\rbuilding from outside.** **\nOnce\rparked at Robber’s cave we changed our shoes for Crocs ;). This is a\rriver cave which has a waterfall (a small one) at the end; almost half a\rkilometer long with a narrow passage. The water was low so it was a\rpleasant walk in summer but at times crowded.** **\nAfter\rcovering these two attractions we decided to leave Dehradun for Haridwar\rpost lunch. We\rhad lunch at a kebab place on the Haridwar road.** **\nRest\rof the drive to Haridwar was OK. Most roadways was an undivided road\rwhich means we have to be extra careful. We crossed the lone airport of\rUttarakhand which is halfway between Haridwar and Dehradun. As we\rapproached Haridwar the traffic increased and one or two places it was\rsnail pace. The last few KM was to our hotel was tricky as we cross the\rGanges and drive through narrow lanes. ** **\nAt\rone point we made a left turn before and we could see Sadhus wearing\rsaffron on Royal Enfield bullets coming. We immediately stopped on the\rside and could see a big procession coming towards to us and an elephant\rleading the gathering. Immediately with a fraction of seconds had turned\rthe car and headed back from we came. It was one of those escapes you\rremember after month while trying to pen down the diary. Soon we were\rnext to the bus stand and railway station. And our stay was next door.\rThe hotel was again from GMVN with a huge parking. ** **\nThis\rtime the hotel was much more cleaner compared to last night. Our room\rwas big and OK. We freshened up and headed towards famous Ganga Aarti on\ra Rickshaw. The journey was like crawling at the end with any rooms with\rso many people and narrow lane. ** **\nEven\rthough it was just 5 in the evening we were already late for Ganga\rAarti. All the available place to view the same were taken and we had to\rsqueeze ourselves. We had to stand separately as I was with camera and\rPamela with Aarush. Lucky for Aarush he found some place to stand to\rpeep through the crowd. The crowd and the atmosphere are altogether a\rdifferent experience and I do not possess the writing skill or the\rphotography skill to narrate the same. It is a must watch if you are\rtraveling to this part of India. The Aarti (evening prayer) is about 40\rmins or so long with many small activities in between.** **\nPost\rAarti we stopped for dinner into a restaurant in the very corner. The\rfood was OK the service was crazy as it was very crowded. We decided to\rwalk back to our hotel. It was around 2 KM of walking and we opted to\rwalk using bylanes full of shops rather than the main road which is\ralways full of honking from bikes.","excerpt":"We\rwork up fresh after a good sleep.

So somehow we finished our packing on Thursday\rnight and set our alarms for early Friday.We\rwoke up on time and got ready and then call for Uber, the app shows the\rtaxi is just next to our apartment where normally few Uber/Ola always\rare found. on tracking it was found no movement, I call the number and\rno one picks. After trying few times I gave up and cancel my trip. Again\rbook another Uber and this time the guys picks up the phone and promised\rto be there in 5 minutes. The cab was an old one the headlight was\rbarely working asked him to switch on the headlight and his response it\ris already on. Well, finger crossed we reached airport and journey to\rDelhi was in peace. We\rlanded on time and called our car rental company they told us to come to\ra designated spot but the wait was quite long. The representative does\rthe handover outside Airport area near Aero City Metro (Mahipalpur\rjunction). Signed few documents took pictures of the car. There were\rlots of dents around ( nothing surprising a rented car in Delhi). The\rcar had around 53K KM on ODO. What was bad is that the car came with\rvery low fuel where the pre-sale promise was it will come with full tank\rfuel. Now it was already 11 and the traffic was horrible and we started\rour journey in crawling speed. The names were familiar but I could not\rrecollect anything about Delhi, like Bhikaji Kama, AIMS, SouthEx\u0026hellip; .\rWe\rcrossed Jamuna and stopped for UP road tax. Now the real UP wala feeling\rcame alive. The tool was only 120/- but the guy wanted 170/- When asked\r50/- is his fees for which there was no receipt. After raising\rmy voice little and asking what is wrong it was agreed at 150/-. We\rcrossed Noida and then entered Ghaziabad. Traffic was getting little\rbetter but the day was getting hotter and hotter. Now I was desperate to\rfind a petrol station. Thanks, Google Maps we had to take few U-turns\rvery confidently as for no reason it asks you to take a road when your\rcommon road sense also tells you it is very wrong. We saw a massive\ramount of newly constructed apartments and people are waving their hands\rto the car so take a look. Indian realty market did not look that\rpromising. We fill our car and then stopped for a quick bite. The food\rwas OK but the moment we come back the car felt like a furnace. The\rroad google map took us bypassed Ghaziabad, Meerut, Muzaffarnagar,\rRoorkee, Dehradun for Mussoorie. We\rstopped before Roorkee to pay road tax for Uttarakhand but now this time\rhas to give 300/- to that guy for which there was no receipt. It was a\rtent where these private operators are working. Only good thing I\runderstood what needs to be done for next time as he did the process in\rfront of me on the computer. As\rsoon as we entered Roorkee the roads just disappeared for some good\rdistance. It was back to crawling speed and minute maneuvering. And it\rseems there is no real bypass as the whole town was on the road. At\rlast, the road got better as we escaped out of Roorkee. We passed\rDehradun around 5/5:30 PM. And from there uphill of 20KM started to\rreach Mussoorie. We were told the road will be tricky but found it OK.\rWe reached Mussoorie when the sun just went down completely behind the\rmountains. As\rusual like any other British hill station this also has Mall road, and\rwe anticipated that it will be closed to vehicular traffic in the\revening. And it was so we had to find a public parking and park our car\rthere. It was a transition from the driving on plains as roads here get\rreally narrow.We\rchecked in our hotel GMVN and oh! No, it was a not a room we were\rexpecting. The staffs were courteous but very slow in response. I\rreally feel bad as most of our hotels are GMVN/KMVN for next 10 days. We\rwalked to another end of the Mall road and had a good dinner. The place\rwas very crowded, but we all have tested better Chinese food. Maybe our\rchoice was not great as the dishes we ordered were extremely spicy or\roily. Now\rwith a little sore mood, we headed back to the hotel and left Aarush for\rsleeping as we walked back to get our car back to the hotel.Oh\rboy! what a parking. You go steeply down from the Coffee day and then\rdrive along two hotels and their parking kissing those cars side\rmirrors. And then there 90° turn to be made. I really do not know how I\rmanaged the same. The hotel guy was there to help me but Pamela was\rscreaming I was maneuvering left, right, front back and what not. Anyway\ronce crossed that hurdle the parking area was just behind our room.\rDisappointed\rso far we just crashed on our bed even without changing our dress. A\rlong day from morning 4 a.m came to an end finally.

Well enough of rant now let me\rtype….Beginning\rof 2017 we were very much looking for a vacation and Pamela was\rinterested in Uttarakhand. Now Uttarakhand is not a big state, it was\rcarved out of Uttar Pradesh around 17 years back(A.D.2000 to be\rprecise). But being a hilly region you can not just go around and see it\rall. There are two main parts Garhwal \u0026amp; Kumaon.\rAnd we were lost in between which part to visit. At the end, we made up\rsome plan after talking to friends who are quite familiar with the UK.\rThat made me more confused. Now comparing to the trip of Himachal\rPradesh 3 years back, I was quite sure would be able to drive myself in\rthe hills unless we plan to visit high altitude areas where roads would\rbe narrow and tricky. Also if you recollect there was a major natural\rcalamity in 2013 which washed away most roads and caused havoc during\rthe peak of summer vacation. And I was not so keen for Dhams (\rseats/abode) yatra as it means visiting temples and religious places. So\rat the end, I posted my planned itinerary\rin\rteam-bhp.Now, as usual, got useful advice and modified our itinerary accordingly.\rNow\rthe plan was to fly to New Delhi and then rent a car and drive to\rUttarakhand. Here is the high-level plan. Night\rat Mussoorie\r-\rMorning flight to From Delhi and then drive to Mussoorie Night\rat Haridwar\r-\rFull day Explore Mussoorie; Leave for Haridwar later Night\rat Haridwar\r-\rExplore Haridwar Night\rat Corbett\rTiger Reserve Night\rat Corbett\rTiger Reserve Night\rat Binsar\r-\rVia Nainital \u0026amp; Almora 5/6 hrs Drive Night\rat Binsar\r-\rBinsar wildlife sanctuary and from there trekking till zero point.\rNext will be seeing the Jageshwar group of temples. Night\rat Kausani\r Night\rat Kausani\r Night\rat Nainital Night\rat Nainital Long\rdrive 7/8 hours \u0026amp; fly out to Bangalore (late evening flight) Hotel\rbookings,I pre-booked Corbett Tiger Reserve using their official\rwebsite.\rThe booking to Corbett is very tricky. You need to be on online and\rready and at your best, I had my caffeine shot just before 10. The\rbooking opens 45 days prior for Indians. And without night booking\rDhikala region the best region to explore within Corbett remains off\rlimit to you.If\ryou are serious about CRT, my simple advice is you MUST have a booking\rat Dhikala. You will see and capture what is totally depends on your\rluck. But just for the experience, you must do the booking in Dhikala\rzone. The other zones are small and open for day safari as well so that\rway they become more crowded. Rest\rof the Hotels are booked via KMVN and GMVN website directly. Also booked\rKausani well before hand as it looked like a good option again\rTeam-BHP.","excerpt":"It\rhas been such a long time that we posted something we almost forgot how\rto type long paragraphs.

While Pamela \u0026amp; Aarush goes back to Bangalore on\rSaturday itself I stay back for the big run on Sunday.\nThey had a train to catch around 9 from ERS. There was not a single auto\raround so had to walk and get one from Ferry station and as usual the\rprice asked and agreed is way more than normal,\nMy running friends already reached from Bangalore while some checked in\rto Hotel other went ahead to Alleppey to check run route for December\rMTR run. There was many small plans and phone calls in the morning about\rhow we meet up and spend our day, At the end I came to the hotel in\rWellington Island around 10. After 11 we start from hotel for BIB\rcollection which is another end of Ernakulam. The bus ride was very long and memorable one not a kind that\ryou suggest. We were swinging …. the drives is rash and the roads are\rnarrow and there is Metro construction going on forever.\nThe BIB collection was happening inside a newly opened mall. And we came\rto know there are not going to many runners around 200 registered for FM\rand another 800 for HM, After usual chit-chat with fellow runners and\rpictures we headed for food. We were told and warned about the bad road\rconditions due to rain and that might impact bare-foot runners most.\rOrganizers were also offering early start at 3AM. But the regular start\rof 4 AM itself was too early for my standard.\nWhile walking to the mall from bus stop spotted the restaurant ‘Dhe\rPuttu’ a place Pamela wanted to go but we did not. While entering the\rplace we liked it but it usual a clean nice restaurant. But when they\rserved the ‘Sulaimani Tea’ things changed drastically for good. We all\rmust had 7/8 cups of tea and some may be more. It seems this restaurant\rbelongs to one of Malaalam actor Dileep. We all loved the food. And the\rbest part we were full. The puttu is very filling and restaurant guys\rservice was excellent. Post lunch we again walked to bus stop and got a\rbus to our hotel. Pamela and Aarush Bangalore reached Bangalore safely in the evening.\rThey mentioned about the rain and cold weather over there. Personally\rhad a shower and nap in the afternoon. But that killed by sleep in the\rnight as I could barely sleep. Race Day Woke up at 3:15 or so and left hotel at 3:30 in Bus (thanks to soles of\rCochin) for the venue. From our group few were doing FM and most were\rdoing HM. In hotel met Balaji, one runners from Chennai who is of my\rkind of running speed. But he has ran many FM including last month\rBangalore on in 4 hours where I took 14 more minutes. It was 3 in the\rbeginning but soon around 6 KM mark I think we lost Patrick and me and\rBalali continued together. We were running side by side but once the\rroad narrowed we started to follow each other. We completed the half way\rmark before 2 hours and headed back and crossed 30K around 2 hr 45\rminutes or so. But once we were back to the Wellington Island we met up\rwith the many slow HM and Family fun (5K) runners. While they had a turn\rto complete their race we had to continue on an isolated roads between\rshipyards and godowns. It was the last KMs that was very dull and\rboring. And now the gap between me and Balaji increased as I really lost\rthe enthusiasm . Thankfully one Hyderabad runner came to rescue around\rlast 500m to give company. And the race got over in 4 hours 7 minutes.\rThe best part not much walking and stopping in the last 5 KMs but there\ris way to improve. May be I shouldI think I have 50KM Ultra to run while\rrunning those 5KM. Post-race as usual Bangalore runner specially Pacemakers were on the\rpodium. And very thankful to two gentlemen who are working in Dubai but\ravid runners gave us lift to Hotel. We checkout and headed towards MG\rroad and ended up going to Grand Hotel for lunch. This is the same place\rwhere we as a family met our Cochin host Gulshan and his family on\rTuesday for dinner.\nThe service was not so great as we were a Bhukkad Gang. Rest of the\rjourney back to Bangalore was fun filled with lots of chitchat which can\rbe shared here ;)\n","excerpt":"Pre-Race Day \nThe day started early, we get out Cochin Club today and part our our\rways for some time.

We\rtraveled in train and return journey was not a great one as we had to\rtravel in sleeper class. The fun was most of us did not had bed linen as\rwe forgot how it was to travel in sleeper class. So Last year though I\rwent with group in train booked my flight ticket for returning and that\rway I was back home on Sunday itself.\nComing to 2015 booked air tickets for going as well. Left Bangalore in\rthe Saturday evening as reached Hyderabad in time for an early dinner\rand heading to bed. My roommate was running full 42.2KM in the toughest\rcity marathon of India. Did not had a good night sleep not from pre-race\ranxiety but due to poor room quality of WoodBridge Grand. This hotel is\rgetting dropped from our Hyderabad running hotels.\nIn the morning all the autos were asking exorbitant price in the early\rto morning to take me to starting point which was only 2 KM away. SoI\rkept walking and good Samaritan offered a ride in his car to Necklace\rRoad railway station.\nWas delighted and surprised to meet up with Prithvi Reddy. It is great\rthat he is running and this was his second year doing Half Marathon.\nDid proper warm-up with few PaceMakers and was confident for a good\renjoyable run. But my Garmin went off before even the race could start\r:) Not sure what went wrong as I recollect had charged it before leaving\rBangalore. Had one large Banana at hotel around 4:45AM \u0026amp;\rClif-Gel\raround 5:45. The digital clock went down before the race director could\rflag off the race so it was not just me having trouble with watch in the\rearly morning.\nKnew\rI was running strong as was able to see Brojen in front of me even\rthough the gap between us was widening. Till the first flyover I could\rsee him but after 5KM mark he really took off. I had a glass of energy\rdrink around 7/8KM mark and another gel around 11KM with water. I love\rmy coffee. I tried my best to cover up on the downhill parts knowing the\rcourse my heart now. Naidu (another PaceMakers) caught up with me around\r15KM mark. Asked him what speed he was running and he mentioned\rsomething around 5, did not bother with that data as I had only one\rthing in my mind the last 3 KMs with Gachibowli flyover. Last two years\rthis is where had my trouble and had to walk for few steps. Surprisingly\rthis year there were families with nice Bollywood numbers to cheer\rrunners and I crossed it without much trouble.\nBut the at the end there was no mark of how much is left and once again\rthere was surprise. As this year also the entry to the stadium was\rchanged and I was not sure how much is left. Only once I saw the stadium\rentry I started sprinting to the finish line. The clock at the finish\rline was clicking 1:43:XX and my heart had no joy as at last I felt I\rcracked the 1:45 mark. I was not super confident with the clock as did\rnot have my own watch to double confirm the same.\nSo\rwith lots of selfies and groupies and chit chat with known runners we\rheaded back for hotel. But getting taxi was not easy but at the end we\rmanaged one with bribe ;). The driver switched off his GPS phone with\rUber. The uber guys caked him few times and he ensured to maintain a\rsilence.\nThe lunch was HUGE at DineHill but these\ryear we were very few runners there. But the whole celebration of 1:45\rgot busted as soon we reached hotel with SMS from TimingIndia. It said\rmy provisional timing is 1:45:43.\nOh! Now you tell me the value of 43 seconds and the difficulties I had\rto explain the same to my non running friends. It was great to run at\ran average 5 KM pace for the whole distance. The weather helped big time\rbut somehow feeling down. In three years my ranking and running had\rimproved (2013 - 2:01,\r2014\r1:50)\rbut I am no longer super excited.\nAt last and not the list, thanks a ton to Hyderabad Runners for their\rexecution in a flawless running event. There were volunteers who were\rexcited and enthusiastic not just holding glass of water. The post run\rarrangement was also great with zero waste. Even though there is nothing\rnew after this 3rd edition for me might comeback one day to complete the\r‘toughest city marathon’ one day.

We need to make an\rentry in the logbook and were reminded no food, no music, no stopping\rand speed up to 30KMPH while crossing the park. We saw lots of spotted\rdeer and few monkeys.

After settled in in we went out for a stroll to\rnearby temple. The owner of the home stay has an excellent taste in\rmaintaining her garden. Just to mention there were hundreds of flower\rpots of different times.\nNext day we went to Irpu falls, only Aarush had a great time showering\rover there. After that we tried to stroll little mode but the weather\rwas too hot. So we headed back to guest house and after shower had a big\rlunch and too a long nap. Evening we went out in search of ATM to nearby\rT.Shettigeri.\nNext day after breakfast we headed out for Bangalore via Shrimangala \u0026amp;\rGonikoppal . The road condition was great. We stopped at Mysore palace\ras Aarush said he wanted to see it. It was very crowded, And we did not\renjoyed it so much. After lunch at Mysore we started back from there and\rexperienced heavy storm and rain as we were about to reach home.\rThankfully that rain just started and we were not stuck for long\ranywhere else it would been a different story at the end.\nNow with school being open not sure when we will go out anywhere soon.\n","excerpt":"So just before school reopens we had out of Bangalore for 2 nights. We\ropted for something closer to home Coorg but on the southern side. We\ropted for this side as we been to more popular side near Madikeri in\r2008 when Aarush was around 9 month old. Time do really fly.\nWe started at 8:30 from home, very late compared to our slandered but\rthat day had Bangalore TCS 10K.","ref":"https://santm.com/blog/2015-06-08-half-early-update/","title":"Half early update"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/baking/","title":"baking"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/cake/","title":"cake"},{"body":" Normal Sponge Cake Carrot walnut cake *Mocha pudding * Date Cake Honeyed Apple slice  \n","excerpt":"Normal Sponge Cake Carrot walnut cake *Mocha pudding * Date Cake Honeyed Apple slice","ref":"https://santm.com/blog/2014-12-17-happy-baking-happy-holidays/","title":"Happy Baking Happy Holidays"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/accident/","title":"accident"},{"body":"Woke up at 4:25 AM ; it was supposed it be a a long day for me as I try\rto run 39 KM practice run in a easy pace. Though I am not going to\rparticipate in the upcoming SCMM (Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon)\r2015 I decided to stick with the full marathoner group to see how\rgrueling their preparation can be. Assembled at 4:45 in front of the NCBS gate and met an ultra marathoner\rfrom our running group who already covered 23KM starting from 02:30 AM.\rOh! boy still trying to keep my eyes and mind open and then you see this\rgreat guy who is running with a BIG SMILE. Really he is a person with\rbig heart and great smile. He has transitioned to braefoot and was\rholding a small flashlight as he keeps on running in dark.\nBeing December we decided to run only in the lighted area till sky gets\rclear which is almost an hour away. We started at 5:15 sharp and\rcontinued till almost 12 KM. Somehow I was running alone though there\rwere two just running behind me. I realized missed the first planned\rwater break after an hour but continued with them. Now sky being clear\rwent for the full round of GKVK and completed 22KM. Had a banana and\rwater and went out for the next round. Somehow in the mind I was\rdetermined for 35KM as was not sure on 39KM. A week before only could do\ra 30KM of running around Jakkur\rlake. As I crossed 28KM I started to feel my calf is burning with pain and I\ram slowing down. I kept on saying to myself there is no stopping\rbefore 35. I completed 30KM in 2:50 which was a very impressive\rachievement in itself. And completed 5 more in 3:22 :) but had to stop\rwith my legs.\nGood thing now these cramps comes after 30/33K earlier may be 18/20K.\nCame home with a quick shower was back to normal. It was a school day\rfor Pamela as they had big annual day for senior class. While me and\rAarush decided to bake a cake (Mocha Pudding) of his choice. Aarush\rwas real gentle he allowed me to take a proper nap in the afternoon and\rdid not touched iPad ;) woke me up on the correct time. \nThe cake was second one from the new cook book called \u0026ldquo;1 Mix 50\rCakes\u0026rdquo;.\rAll went super smooth, cake came out nice. Pamela called saying she is\ron her way to home and I thought to clean up few tea cups and glasses\rfrom sink and BANG I realized the glass I was holding slipped \u0026amp; hit the\rside of the sink and oh! no blood and blood all around. I had no choice and tried to put turmeric powder from kitchen shelf to\rstop the flow, it slowed down but could not stopped it completely. I\rprepare myself to drive down to hospital and luckily Pamela made her\rentry as an angel in the door. We three went to hospital emergency. Soon\rit was all about getting the wound cleaned and prepared for the stitch\rwork. Got four stitches on my little left finger and headed back home.\r\nCould not stop myself thinking about the definition of accident\u0026hellip;.\rwhile in road many a times it is because two or three person taking\rchance and they met an accident and later blame each other for the same.\rHere there was not a single soul around me. God knows how many times\rwashed fragile items and nothing happened and today after cutting so\rmany wine bottles with perfection I am wounded without any\ranticipation. Still this Saturday will be remembered as one of my best run and\rawesome cake :)\n","excerpt":"Woke up at 4:25 AM ; it was supposed it be a a long day for me as I try\rto run 39 KM practice run in a easy pace.

It started like just another\nmonth of the year.\nHonestly it has 17th September which is most times ‘Bishwakarma Puja’\nand Pamela’s B’day and that is how I remember it. From childhood\nBishwakarma puja has a special mention growing up in Tripura. After\nSaraswati puja in January/February there was no major festival till\nBishwakarma Puja. And there used to pandals and people going out in the\nevening to visit those pandals. Also soon after Bishwakarma Puja the\nannual festival season starts where we celebrate Durga Puja and others.\nAnd normally the weather would be great where monsoon is over and\nclimate were getting pleasant. But you ask about the weather for 2014 it is a mixed bag. The monsoon\nwas delayed in Bangalore there was hardly much rain during June and\nJuly. The rain started to pick up in September and October and we had\n2014 a one of the wettest year in recent time where there was traffic\nchaos and what now when it rained heavily for few days in September and\nOctober.\nPersonally was in a training plan to run my first Marathon(42.2KM) with\npractice with maiden Bengaluru Marathon. But my training came to\ngrinding halt as suddenly things at family took a turn for worse. Pamela\nhad to rush to Durg to take care of her father who was sadly\nhospitalized after a severe fall. Me and Aarush managed well in\nBangalore. It was bit of a driving as I had to drop him early in the\nwest of Bangalore and come to work in the east. End of September the price of IPhone 5 started to drop in Indian on-line\nstores. Last year (2013) I also noticed the same for one phone which I\nwas willing to spend but ten realized the price starts to go up after\nthe initial offer. So this year I made no mistake and booked one IPhone\n5s for 33K and there was some cashback offers from leading credit card\ncompanies. Ironically the price of 5s now at 42K INR after the Iphone 6\ncame to market. Not sure who will buy a older product when the newer one\nis not that far off. A person who is willing to spent 42K Sure will\njustify a spent of 53K for the latest model. I am not an apple fan boy but have to admit the phone is what I was\nlooking for ? and loving it so far so good.\nThe Durga puja was a special one as we celebrated the same in Bangalore\nwith one of my beloved maternal-aunt and her family. So we have the\nusual pendal hopping eating outside. The 3 days just flew away. \nNow with all that came my birthday which was a very simple affair as\nthings was not great again in Durg. And 4 days after that was Bangalore\nmarathon. I had to make a hard choice of either run a Half Marathon or\ncrawl a full marathon and after lot of deliberation I opted for the 1st\none. It was an wise decision as I was struggling with 26 KM after coming\nback to running after an month. \nSo here is my quick report on Bangalore Marathon. 1:47:10 @ Avg 5:03!!\nEnjoyed the race, did not had any target in mind at start other than\nfinishing strong. Enjoyed the run and went with family for the Charity\nrun after that. Here is my splits looks like if I practice well a 1:45\nfor HM in a good race is a possible target. Special thanks to\nKothandapani Sir and my extended family of PaceMakers. UNfortunately the\nworld media picked one news which was not great when lead pack of\nrunners lost race route. The race organizers were great who shared the\nprice money to these individuals in later days.\nThankfully I picked up long running again on the weekends and back to\n30+KM on weekends but still a full marathon looks so daunting task.\n","excerpt":"Month of September 2014 was a unique one.

This run is little special to me as received my first\rever finisher T-shirt last year as a proof of my improvement in running.\rAlso there is the big culinary charm of Dine-hill and Karachi biscuits\ras post run celebration.\nBooked myself a return flight as soon as the dates for AHM 2014 was out.\rFew of my fellow runners also opted for the same as soon as I posted the\rsame in our FaceBook group.\nThe initial count was around 40 people going from our group alone this\ryear but pre-race almost half of them dropped out due to various\rreasons. Myself was in worst running form as I got a Viral beginning of\rAugust which kept me away from any physical activity for 2 weeks. Just\rbefore the race week restarted running and was not even in a position to\rcomplete an easy pace 20km before the race week.\nThe train journey on Garib-Rath was wonderful with all the fellow\rrunners. This time I did not took any food for myself for own dinner but\rthere was so much homemade food on the train from others. I did not get\rmuch sleep over night but it was OK.\nWe got down at Begaumpet railway station and another running group\r(BHUKMP) from Bangalore joined us. This time we were staying together in\ra super nice hotel called\rMarigold. It was a chatty walk\rfrom the railway station to the hotel. Hotel staffs were super-efficient\ras they managed to checked-in 60+ runners with ease and then we had a\rbig breakfast. I had lots of healthy stuff lots of curd, fruits and\rmuesli. We went to expo from hotel thanks to Uber for free ride ;)\nThe expo was mixed bag most counters were well-organized and we were\rhanded our running BIB and goody bag promptly but few were not so lucky.\rMet with lots of great runners with full ‘Josh’ (enthusiasm) whom came\rfrom across the country. Realized there will be no finisher t-shirt for\rthe top runners from Nike. In a way it took off lots of pressure from me\ras I was not really ready for a race yet.\nAfter returning to the hotel I declined to join the group lunch as every\rone headed to Paradise for the\rfamous biryani and ‘qubani ka meetha’\nAfter watching TV and some nap I got up in the evening and joined the\rgroup again for a early dinner. Had a light dinner with lots of Dal\r(lenthil) and curd.\nRace-day : Woke up around 4AM, had a quick shower and had two banana\rand couple of dates. Dressed myself for a hot and sunny day. Again\rthanks to Uber reached the starting point of Necklace road. By the time\rwe finished warm-up could already feel it was going to be a very hot\rday. I ensured to take water break at 2KM and 6KM early on. Thanks to Metro\rwork there was some shades from those safety partitions. But soon they\rwere also gone. I was running alone all along as could not find any one\rwith a similar pace to run along. Most of the time I was crossing\rsomeone but there were few who crossed me along the whole path. As I ran this race before I was mentally strong and was able to map the\rcourse mentally and pushed myself for the best. I was also ensure that I\rwas enjoying the run I ensured to thank many volunteers and give them\rhigh-five as I crossed them The volunteers specially Waste\rWarriors did a superb job of ensuring\rthe street remains clutter free. I had my Glue-Gel around 11KM mark I\rdid not tried any pre-race gel. All was going fine and I knew the last fly-over will be a killer and it\rreally killed me. It was the worst as I almost lost the battle with it\r18 KM was my slowest when I reviewed my Garmin later. I tried my best to\rpush myself as I was approaching G. M. C. Balayogi Athletic Stadium. But\rto my surprise the entry to the stadium was changed from last year and I\rwas completely hear-broken as I did not have any energy in myself to\rpush further. Somewhere I knew it was only 500m to complete the race but\rI also not sure if it was 700m as did not want to victim of heat,\rdehydration and another DNF at the last meters.\nI did what I best could and finished the race at 1:50:29. It was huge\rimprovement compared to last year the result below is the testimony. The\rheat and sun was a killer this year and my face tells that. In a way very happy that I finished strong but on the other hand I\rwished I had little extra energy and strategy to finish the same around\r1:48 and wished to run along someone as it was a boring city roads and\rflyovers.\nIt was the last outstation race of the year 2014-15 for me. \n\n\n\n","excerpt":"After Chennai DRHM event the event I signed up for was Airtel Hyderabad\rHalf Marathon.

After waiting\rfor weeks and getting constant update on social media that my friends\rare being tagged in various albums I could not found a single picture of\rmyself what a pity when everyone was clicking with those super sharp\rDSLRs and smart phones.\nLike last year we travelled to Chennai in Shatabdi Express on Saturday\rstarting early morning from Bangalore. The train journey was fun there\rwere many familiar faces along with few faces of our group. Some from\rthe last year opted out this year but at the end it was almost same\rnumber of people. Had a good sleep on train this time and could not\rparticipate in \u0026lsquo;Gupshap\u0026rsquo;. The journey to hotel this year was very smooth\rcompared to last year as we had a local Chennaite with us. We got down\rfrom the bus right in front of our hotel in Adiyar.\n\nHad a big tasty south Indian veg-lunch at Sangeetha; the walk from the\rhotel was little long as we got used to the hot \u0026amp; humid Chennai. I tried\rmy best to skip sleeping in the afternoon, evening we had long chat over\rtea/coffee at Anand Bhavan about running and various upcoming events\rlike how and when we are going to participate on those. Suddenly it\rstarted to rain like cat and dog which was refreshing and brought down\rthe temperature little bit but shooted humidity to higher level. Dinner\rwas a low key affair for us who opted to come back to Anand Bhavan. Some\rof our friends had the dinner at hotel and was not so delighted with\rtheir service.\nThere was the Iran Argentina group match for World Cup and I wanted to\rwatch it so I kept myself glued to the TV till half-time. A great\rdefense and tactical match from Iran where they blocked Argentina from\rscoring anything till the last minute.\nI got up around 3:45 as we were supposed to assemble at hotel lobby at\r4:15 ; I had one banana, one Parx chocolate some dates and some water.\rRemembering last year I tried to drink water previous day to hydrate my\rbody and kept my food simple. The moment came out of the AC room\rrealized this morning is going to be a tough one. We jogged from hotel\rto the start line which was around 1.6KM, by the time we reached the\rstarting pointed many of us were socked in sweat. Personally dressed\rvery light in a super thin sleeveless vest to keep myself cool.\nStarted the run with fellow runners from my running group and by the\rtime we crossed 2KM mark we were completley sweating. But the good part\rthe sky was dark and we were doing around 5 minute a KM for first 8 or 9\rKM. In that course me \u0026amp; my running buddy crossed few others from our\rrunning group who normally runs faster than us. It was a good and bad\rsign - definitely I did not had a target , its either a sign of running\rfast now and having a physical problem in the later part or the\rweather is playing its part and we are coping better than others.\nAround 9 KM when we were running along the beach my running buddy slowed\rdown a bit and I continued with the pace that I was comfortable and\rstopped looking at GARMIN. Around 18th KM meet with all the slow\rrunners / walkers from 10K race and had to navigate them as I passed.\rAround 19th KM near Adiyar bridge found the local Chennaite from our\rgroup running very strong and crossed me. That motivated me to follow\rhim and I kept reminding myself how a 2KM feels like in our practice\rruns and tried to make my strides longer. I did my best to finish\rstrong and gave my best in last 500 meters or so.\nAs I was relatively faster this time there was not so much queue for\rpost run breakfast I drank many cold bottle of water which were easily\ravailable that time. My roommate did a wonderful run of 10K and cut-down\rhis previous best record by 4 min to complete the same in 42 minutes and\rwas celebrating the same. Called Pamela to let her know I was fine and\rall went OK.\nAfter 10/15 minutes or so when we as a group started to ensemble someone\rreported one of from our group is having health issue and need medical\rassistant. I went and was with him during the whole time he was\rdehydrated and collapsed after finishing the race \u0026amp; while waiting in\rbreakfast queue. Any way he had a bad time with dehydration which caused\rhis BP to go down and needed drip. Oh! tell you when you are in medical\rtent of a race you see the whole race and post-race celebration with a\rdifferent lens.\nMet with LilyDi and SameerDaa for lunch at their home, wow what a yummy\rfood it was with so many courses of fish.\nAs usual train ride back to Bangalore was less eventful and many had a\rnap after a hard race day.\nI did a personal best this time which I realized little late, for me\rbeing able to run and enjoy the same was more important than the time.\rBut I think these few things really helped me in getting there.\n Train enough and train hard for race, as race has so many unknown. Taper down your training . Rest enough even it means watching TV or reading a book if you do\rnot get proper sleep in hotel bed. Try your best to keep mind away from ‘target’, ‘pace’ and ‘timing’\rjust enjoy the run as much as you can unless your are professional\rrunner. Dress accordingly avoid experiment. Hydrate enough but do not overdo it like I did last year where I\rwas barely running the last 5KMs. So I kept a water bottle with\rmyself 6KM onwards and had small gulp on regular intervals. But I\rdid not stopped in many water station as I like to have water when I\rwant. Some cannot run with a bottle in their hand so it is better\rto stop at water station and drink , find out what works for you. Do not try to eat too much or too fancy on previous day. If you have friends or relatives to meetup keep it post-race.

Shoreline being my\rprimary running course, it was very natural that I participated and was\rvery happy with same. However, being the first race, still remember\rthat Sunday morning quite well and had that T-shirt for long time as a\rmemorabilia.  Now after 14 years, today morning I just\rdid a quick search and wondering if there will be a digital foot print\rfrom that race? Look what found in few seconds. I am really emotional\rto see that I was there.

From Bangalore we need\rto go via Sarjapur, Bagalur in Housr District of TamilNadu. Google name\ris Amuthugondapalli. Due to exam time many people could not come but it\rwas still a sizable group of 30. Myself and Aarush joined another dad \u0026amp; son in car-pool to drive down\rthere. Both the boys of same age became better and bitter friends\rquickly. The road was a long one for us as we have to travel on ORR to\rSarjapur Junction and pass Decathlon and Sarjapur village till we\rreached Baglur Village. From there we took a right turn next to Police\rstation and drive for 7+ KM to reach a place with a sign for Tenaflora.\rWe were the first one to reach and as soon as Aarush and Abhinav got out\rof the car started to run and explore the vast open space. Soon we were joined with our hostess and other group members. She\rbriefed us on a quick background the farm and how it works and we stared\rthe guided tour. Roses are pretty but they needs lots of care and best\rresources to grow. The green houses are computer controlled to ensure\rthe right level of temperature and humidity is maintained. The water\rthat needs to be filtered and ensured right level of pH and EC\rmaintained. If you are wondering what is this EC it is Electrical\rConductivity of water may be we studied somewhere long time ago. There\rwere those huge cold storage where unsorted and sorted roses are kept\ronce they are picked form the green-house. The whole process is very\rtedious and labor intensive just like tea. Like tea garden ladies work\rwith their delicate hands for sorting and ensuring right set of roses\rare packed together. The global standard is of 20 rose stems in one. We\rcompleted the post plucking production from un-sorted roses to a final\rpacking and ready to be shipped in those big card-board box.\nAfter that we had a stupendous lunch spread before us. The outside\rtemperature was very hot but after a rest we walked towards green house.\rIt was really hot out there. Inside greenhouse it was a great relief and\rit reminded us Shilshila. Growing up in India in 70/80s you it is kind\rof marked in your memory with permanent marker. Here we saw how they\rtake care of each buds right from when they are in the size of peanuts. The best was kept for the last each of us were given a rose bouquet of\rdifferent colors.

Well the weekend was supposed to be\ra just another weekend on the calendar with no specific plan. There were\rsome weekend work/changes/releases at office but not a major ones.\rNowadays my running group is doing long runs on Saturday instead of\rSunday. And I thought to myself if I start sharp at 5 I should be able\rto finish by 7:15 and back home before 7:30 so that I can take care of\rAarush.\nOn Friday I headed to bed early put the alarm for 4:15 and I left home\rfor GKVK at 4:30. It was bit spooky to reach there and be alone in the\rdark. The only street light was working was around gate of NCBS. So did\rfew short rounds of quick jogging on the road luckily there were no\rstray dogs. As I was finishing up my warm up exercises one by one my\rrunning group members started to show up. Without much time at hand I\rstarted running alone in the dark. I was thinking the faster ones will\rcross me any time after 15-20 minutes and then the others will follow.\rBut saw my running buddies almost when I completed first loop and was at\r9.8+ KM mark. I joined them back and to complete the remaining part\rwithout a break as I was carrying a small water bottle. Soon the second\rloop almost started to get complete and finished 20K in 1:50. At 20KM mark reached back to car and had little water break and then\rstarted the last 3KM. Now the real challenge was supposed to be faster\rby 1 minute for the last 3 KMs. I did OK and finished them within target\rshared by coach. It was 7:12 and with that headed back home. By the time\rI reached home Pamela already left for work and our maid and cook were\rbusy working. Aarush was still asleep. Complete the workout with some\rstretching exercise; it was a real achievement to run 20+3KM within the\rplan.\nAfter that had a quite morning, Aarush woke up, we completed shower,\rbreakfast \u0026amp; homework. He played little bit of games on Ipad while I\ruploaded my running details in GARMIN. Around 11ish dropped Aarush to\rAbacus class this was his 3rd session, something to keep him away from\rTV and IPAD on the weekends. Picked Aarush and Pamela around 1PM, after lunch had a nice nap and\rwhith my best try Aarush did not slept. But he was ready for some rounds\rof roller blades within our apartment complex. It was kind of boring so\rcalled even friends with a hope if they are free; will catch up with\rthem.\nAfter 9:30 in the night there was some glitch at work so spent some time\ron that issue ; was thinking to join Nike Run Club with Pamela on Sunday\rMorning. Sunday morning the alarm went off on correct time but two of us were\rlazy to go out - a perfect Sunday morning finished Breakfast late then\rcompleted household chores. Had lunch on time followed by a nap. I\rreally felt good after a long time that got a restful weekend. The following day being Holi – festival of colors. There was some\rcelebration within our complex ; Pamela and Aarush stayed there while I\rcame home to prepare dinner.\nAfter 30 minutes or so Aarush came back home and said he is not going to\rhave dinner and going for sleep. Got little irritated with this as how\rhe can skip his dinner and go to sleep; called Pamela and spoke about\rthe same. So after 3 min (precise time from phone call log) I went\rinside and asked Aarush to change his dress and I washed his hand and\rface. While pat drying his hand my almost perfect weekend came to an\rabrupt halt and left me jolted on seeing Aarush left hand was completely broken and it was\rtwisted. \nI ran got some first aid to support his hand and called Pamela again\rinforming her to return immediately. And we rushed to ER of hospital\rnext door. Everyone at hospital was shocked that how this 6 year old was not crying\ror howling and showing a brave expressionless face. They called the\ron-call orthopedic and by the time completed his first round of X-ray.\nThe only sound that came from him was when they applied traction to\rstraighten his hand. Again another round of x-ray to confirm whether the\rsetting was OK and finally we came home. Well today is only Tuesday and tomorrow evening we need to visit\rhospital again for another round of x-ray to confirm all is OK before\rthey put a complete hard cast on his hand for 6 weeks. Today, I feel bad not for his broken hand but for hiding this incident\rbecause of the fear of being scolded . Looks like I failed completely\rand still trying to find an answer what triggered him to behave like\rthat as on the same evening I have spent a good time on the play ground\rwith him before leaving for home to prepare his favorite dinner. the x\n","excerpt":"Aarush reminded me it\u0026rsquo;s Friday, at breakfast table and that he should\rhave the I-Pad with charger for the Weekend; somehow he remembers when\rit is Friday very well for his age.

I personally travelled\rhere and there for single nights few times due to running and other\rpersonal work. The worst was to spend a week in Calcutta just after\rDurga Pooja and not able to accomplish anything there. So when December\rvacation time was only few days away I booked for Goa for 4 nights\rwithout much thinking. Personally felt quite happy with the booking as\rgot a decent price for Goa just before X-mas.\nWe left Bangalore on Saturday morning at around 04:30 morning; the road\rcondition was great and for the first time I was maintaining 100/110\rKPMH. The road widening on NH4 between Chitradurga and Neelmangla was\rcompleted and now we have 3 lanes on each side. We stopped at Kamat\rbefore Haveri and soon reached Hubli around 10ish. From there we left\rthe toll road but the road condition did not deteriorate at all. Thanks\rto Supreme Courts’ verdict on Illegal mining : ) there was no over-sized\rdumper carrying Iron ores. We reached Karwar by 12 and did not felt like\rstopping for lunch that time. On entering Goa border we had to pay\rwhooping 250 INR as entrance fees which was little surprising for us as\rnever had to pay such fees with Private self-driven car in India.\nWe reached our hotel Colva kinara around 14:00, so first we had\rlunch and then checked in later. While checking-in got a shock of life\rtime. There was mention of “Mandatory Gala Dinner on 24th Dec 2012(X-Mas\rEve)” but the price of the same was never mentioned while booking and\rpersonally did not open the hotel coupon to read the fine prints. Now\rHotel guys were asking rs.3000 per person for the same so in total 7500\rfor our family of 2 and half . Called up MakeMyTrip and told them they\rshould have made this clear prior booking as it was too extravagant\ramount being asked by the hotel but looks like there was no option other\rthan paying. It was a bad start .\nVisited family and friends twice on the northern side in the evening ;\rit was OK drive but quite long. The 4 nights stay at the hotel was event-less but the hotel was not a\rgreat for the money we spent. These 4 days we really not did do much\rother than drinking, eating, walking to beach, take a swim at sea and\rrepeat the same. As got robbed on the day one due to that great dinner\rthought of extending the stay and even out the damage. Checked for a\rproperty in Agonda beach (further south close to Karwar) and decided\rto go there. The plan was if they provide us with decent room we stay or\relse we go back. The property was right on the beach and it was beach\rhut called Dersy\u0026rsquo;s beach hut with minimum bare amenities. For\rexample there was no running hot water but all we were looking for was\rbeach, sand and tranquility.\nThe next 3 days were more or less similar we had breakfast at ‘On the\rway’ German bakery, lunch somewhere and dinner at “La Dolice\rVita”. Both the place were excellent in terms of quality of food and\rprice. Last day, we went to Palolem beach at \u0026ldquo;Cozy nook huts\u0026rdquo;\rright on the beach and enjoyed our lunch there.We really liked them.\rAfternoon were pretty hot even in December- mostly left with no option\rother then power nap. Two evenings I did barefoot running along the\rbeach in the evening. But ended up getting body ache and eventually\rfever. The drive back on Saturday was hard on me being sick and Aarush too was\rdown with fever. We skipped lunch as didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like eating that\rafternoon. I had to take a power nap (after lots of request from Pamela)\rfor 40 minutes. But the sad part is no CCD(cafe coffee day) around or\rdecent break area along this NH4 while returning. There is one CCD only\rnear Tumkur and that too on the other side for which I was not at all\rkeen to take 2 U-turns on the Highway. Thinking back, the drive back\rwest when the sun is in-front of you its not at all easy to drive and\rended up with severe headache accompanied with fever.\nSo after a wonderful week of vacation, I was completely down with Viral\rfever for almost a week and had to visit a Doctor and take antibiotic\rmedication to recover. So going to Goa in the peak of season may not be\ra great idea as hotel price is just sky rocket at that time.\n","excerpt":"In 2013 we had very little family vacation time.

We reported\rthat back to Calcutta the tour operator Mr. D. Ghosh. But once you are\raway from home and you have limited option to negotiate a bargain. The\rHotel person by now have charged us 2500 for the first day covering only\rTagore Smritivan , monastery and forest bungalow. For the second day we\rpaid 2500 to cover 5/6 places but the distance was more. By now we have\rchecked few blogs and travel sites thanks to borrowed usb modem and\rquite certain that we are being robed :( The charge for travelling to\rBurniok to Kurseong was a whopping 4500. Somehow by now we kind of lost\rfaith on that travel agent :( of Calcutta. Only good part we got a new Mahindra Xylo and started travelling back to\rJorethang on the same road and took a turn there towards Kurseong The\rroad was really bad as we entered West Bengal luckily we were in a SUV.\rThe road was narrow, long and without any major village to stop or rest\rover for few minutes.\nWe called the guest house in Kurseong to get a direction and he\rexplained the same to our driver. On the way weather also changed its\rmood and it became very dark and started to rain as we approached\rKurseong. Ghum (highest point on Toy train line ) was completely\rsubmerged in cloud. We could hardly see anything beyond few meters. Once\rwe reached Kurseong we were lost with direction and had to come back to\rtowards Darjeeling again to reach our home-stay. The home-stay is on a\rhill top near St. Mary. We approached it via such a narrow lane that\rthere was no chance for our SUV to go to the end and had to drag our\rluggage ourselves. It was not a pleasant way to approach a new place \u0026amp;\rmoreover there was no help from the home-stay and it was raining. By the\rtime we got into our room it was almost 2:30 PM and it was really cold.\rAlthough the house had wooden floor but it was really cold and we felt\rlittle unprepared for this weather in the middle of summer. We had some\rhot Maggi and sandwiches as snack or late lunch. My mother decided for a\rrest while we decided to explore the market of Kurseong. So we walked\rback to the highway (Darjeeling -Siliguri NH 55) and got a shared\rjeep (taxi) which took us to the market.\nThe market we explored about travel option of our own this time. We\rfixed one taxi for next day\u0026rsquo;s sightseeing and also inquired about rate\rfor going to Darjeeling and Siliguri. With that our suspicion became\rreality ? that we were cheated by our travel agent.\nWe walked around the market area and it started to rain. We left the\rmarket area behind and tried our luck in stopping a taxi to drop us\rback. But that turned out negative and we continued and reached\r“Kurseong Tourist Lodge”. Stopped there for a break we ordered\rcoffee and French fries for Aarush. Must admit after a long time had a\rgood coffee in the kingdom of tea :). The sky got little cleared and we\rstarted walking back again on NH 55 to reach our home-stay. Walking\ralong the Highway and toy train had its share of fun. Aarush did an\rexcellent walk of 3 KM walk with uphill. Dinner was a simple-one\regg-curry with rice and we headed to bed as it was really a long day for\rus.\nNext day, the weather was not better compared to first day. After\rbreakfast we started with our sightseeing. The first stop was Dow Hill\rGirls School. The place was not open to public that day and due to\rrain and cloud we could hardly see anything. This school is 130+ years\rold started in 1879. From there we went to Dow Hill (Deer Park)\rwhich is little further on the same road. It seems there is a big plan\rto make a zoo/entertainment park with rope-way in couple of years.\rKnowing it is West Bengal I have personal doubt that it will ever be\rmade.\nFrom there we went to Makaibari Tea Estate, normally on a regular\rday you can visit the factory and have a guided tour of tea leave\rprocessing. But being Sunday factory was closed and we just bought some\rtea. En route we passed Castleton Tea estate which is one of the\rmost expensive Darjeeling\rtea.\rWhile heading back we stopped for few minutes to explore Cochrane\rPlace and taking\rpictures around tea garden as Sun suddenly came out between the cloud.\rThis resort/hotel is really cool and worth checking out if you are\rlooking for better stay with excellent view.\nAfter this we came to TV tower which is also known as Eagle Crag. It\ris a high point and provides panoramic view of the valley down . The sky\rwas not very clear but it was better than the initial morning and we\rcould see the road going to Siliguri and the great flat land near from\rthere. The river Torsa;’s white mark was very faint.\nThe driver suggested some options which really did not appealed us but\rthen he suggest Goethals Memorial School. For that we drove past our\rhome-stay. This time we got lucky and guard let us in the school yard.\rThis school is the boy’s convent started in 1907. There are many\rdistinguished alumni’s who represented India from Olympics to Corporate\rleadership. It was a real nice feeling to explore this school from\routside, reminded us of the Montfort School of Yercaud,TN.\nThe driver dropped us back to the same place where we had snacks\rprevious day evening. The place was packed with tourist but luckily we\rmanaged a table and had some hot meal there. We went back to our\rhome-stay with a local Taxi.\nNow like weather our camera also made a big drama, one of the plastic\rpins of memory card got broken and it refused to work. We explored St\rMary’s Hill in the evening. It was a nice stroll from home-stay. We\rcrossed Eastern Forest Rangers' College (another British\rLegacy) on our way. It is a scenic natural area covered with lush green\rforests all around and the way leading to The Grotto. A statue of\rMariam (Mother of Isa) is placed inside a open cave. There were only one\ror two worshipers when we were there to lit candles.\nWell that is also end of Kurseong, settled the bill \u0026amp; booked a Taxi for\rnext day morning to take us early in the morning to train station to get\ra ride on famous Toy train to Darjeeling\n","excerpt":"The\rfirst-daywe\rgot little suspicious with the transport rates being quoted by Kanchan\rView Hotel Manager.

But big thanks\rto Maa and Pamela as they supported to run me this event. Initial plan\rwas Pamela to drop Maa at airport, but at the end Maa said she would go\rvia Taxi of her own. I traveled in car with fellow runners post lunch on\rSaturday and with small coffee break reached Mysore around 18:30. We had\ra simple South-Indian rice meal - a well carb-loading with rice. The\rhotel we stayed was 100 meters from the start/finish line.\nOn the race day we did not had to wake up that early compared to\rweekends run as run was starting at 06:30.

Was double minded\rabout the tee as it felt little chilled as we walked out of the hotel.\rBut as soon as did warm-up felt great about the choice of attire.\nInitial plan I had in my mind was to stick with one lady runner from our\rgroup and try to finish as best I could. We started together but around\r2KM mark there was little down hill and I continued my pace which I was\rcomfortable once I go ahead from her. I continued my own pace and most\rtime did not checked my garmin at all. I knew I was running faster than\rnormal weekend runs but there was no discomfort. Around the lake where\rwe took \u0026ldquo;U\u0026rdquo; turn could see all the the elites were coming back and a\rmajority of them were from our group.

I tired my best to push myself and get get a 1:50 finish.\rWell a minute shorter I would have beat my own record from 2003. But the\rlength of the race is not 21.1 so if I really need to finish 1:50 next\rtime I need to save 2/3 minutes overall and a target of around 1:45\rwould be dream come true.\nSpecial thank to\rFlashbulbzz\rfor the capturing these wonder pictures.\n","excerpt":"This was Mysore Celebration Run 2013 ; well there was BIG celebration at\rPacemakers running group.

And moreover, was advised against it during late April \u0026amp; Early\rMay as there is a high chances of rain during that time. So we had no\rplan and no places to visit while we are going to be in Siliguri for\r10/12 days.\nWe called one travel agent in Calcutta from train and told him about our\rrequirement and he said he would be able to put an itinerary of 6 nights\r( 2nights Sikkim, 2 Kursuang and 2 in Darjeeling). We had no clue on the\rsuggested itinerary as we were too preoccupied with our trip to Gaya.\nDay-1 \nThe d-day before of our trip cab driver called and informed us he is\rcoming down to pick us. He suggested it would be a good idea to start\rfrom Siliguri as early as possible. We started around 7 from home to\rBermiok (West Sikkim) via Sevoke road. The road along Assam riffles was\rjust magnificent straight road without any potholes(a miracle in India)\rand trees lined on the both side. Soon we were climbing the twisted\rroads and crossed Coronation Bridge over the Teesta river ( few\rdays later the bridge become news when “An Indian Guinness World Record\rholder who attempted to cross a river suspended from a zip wire attached\rto his ponytail has died during the stunt”. We continued on the\rSiliguri-Gantogk(NH31A) road and took a turn at Melli for Jorethang\rand continued on Melli-NayaBazar Road. After Jorthang the road became\rmore steeper and narrow you really need to know how to manage those\rhills and steep incline and hairpin bends with zero visibility. Only\rrelief was there were not many cars on the road. We reached Bermiok\rafter passing by Nayabazar, Rinchenpong, Kaluk. The road was\rmore or less well maintained but many places would be quick target of\rrains and land-slide is common which would cause major havoc for\rcommuters.\nThe Hotel( Kanchan Hotel) was pre-booked and we were the only one\rto stay there. Surprisingly, the last visitor to this place was two\rmonths back. The rooms were nothing great but as they are on the hill\ryou could see Kanchenjunga Range from your room. Suddenly, we realized\rwe are feeling cold as this place is 5650 ft above MSL. But the\rcaretaker gave us the first surprise mentioning we need to spend 2500 on\rTaxi for sight seeing. It was a shock but we did not have a choice. In\rthe meantime, the sky was getting cloudy which is very common post noon\rin hills. We had a simple Bengali lunch Dal, some veggies and fish.\nPost lunch we started with Tagore Smriti , a nice park dedicated to\rRabindranath Tagore. Personally, doubt did Tagore ever visited this part\rof Sikkim as there is no solid proof for the same but the local tour\rguides thinks he did. From there we went to Rinchenpong monastery. There\rwere small monks inside the monastery for their afternoon classes so we\rdid not went in. This is a very old monastery built in 1717 with wood.\rThe driver/guide told us there is another monastery ( Resum\rMonastery) if we are willing to walk up-hill. We wanted to explore so\rcontinued it was long walk up-hill with many steps. My mother stopped\rclimbing in the middle and we three continued. It was a price-less walk\rreminding Master-card Advertisement as it was complete silence and the\rsoundings are too green and pristine. Once we reached the top there was\rnot much to see honestly. There is a old monastery which seems now part\rof dispute between different sect or family and there are few families\rstaying as caretaker. Photograph of the monastery was not allowed so we\rtook some pictures outside and headed back.\nNow we headed towards to the British “Dak-Bunglow”( Now Government\rGuest House) , we crossed Poison lake on the way. The story of\rpoison lake goes like this “when the British attacked Sikim(1860). They\rreached up to Rinchenpong when Lepchas (the original inhabitants of\rSikkim) poisoned the water of the pond, the only source of water in\rRinchenpong. In the process killing almost half of the British troops\rand forcing them to retreat.”\nWell it became dark by 4:30 PM and we headed back to hotel and enjoyed\rhot tea with pakodas. Sitting at the rooftop restaurant we enjoyed clear\rsky and innumerable number of stars glittering on the sky, the lights of\rPelling and Gayzing was illuminating like diamonds. Cold was getting\runbearable so after an early dinner we retreated to the room quickly.\nDay-2 \nWow! what a sun-rise with rain washed blue sky we got a clear view of\rKanchenjunga Range. It was simply magnificent. We clicked many shots\rand special thanks to Pamela for being up so early. Post breakfast we\rleft for other local destinations. We started with Chayataal a\rpicnic spot. This a Government resort on a remote hill top. The road is\rreally bad there was no tar and with previous night rain it was really\rmuddy. We found it bit strange and could not understand why government\rof Sikkim is allowing guest house/hotel/Govt- Bunglow like mushrooms. If\rit continues for another couple of years this remote part will become\rlike Uttarakhand tsunami one day.The USP for this western Sikkim is\rremoteness, being closer to nature with plenty of trees if that is gone\rit will be a real shame.\nFrom Chayataal as headed down we stopped at Rock Garden; another\rpark/picnic spot. It is located next to a stream and it was walking up\rand down taking pictures. The place is really nice to enjoy yourself\rwith nature and not being bothered as there was no other tourist around.\nNow we traversed the hills towards Pelling(Major town of West\rSikkim) and crossed the beautiful valley of Dentam, stopped at\rCheese Factory and bought some cheese for ourselves,. We took the\rroad going towards Uttarey and visited the famous suspension bridge\r‘Sinshore bridge.’ From Sinshore Bridge we took an U-turn came down\rto Dentum and drove towards Changey falls. Now we are on the\rcomplete opposite hill range and could see the road that we came in the\rmorning. The Changey falls was OK but as we were end of summer there was\rnot much water but good enough.\nOn the way back to Dantum we asked the driver to stop Kalej Khola,\rthis is near Dantum Bridge. We went to the stream to soak our feet the\rwater was cold but it was really relaxing. We were hungry and headed\rback to our hotel for lunch. Post lunch we went for a stroll on the same\rroad for couple of kilometers.\n","excerpt":"We initially planned to visit Bhutan during summer vacation of ’13.\rSomehow during the planning phase we found it was overshooting our\rbudget.

Wished for a\rgadget to record my thought as I was too tired to use any keyboard or\rvoice recorder. At times we wonder and sometime make fun of those award\rceremonies where people on the stage keep on thanking people around him\ror her and sometimes even their dogs. I always love to read the preface\rof a book where authors thank about their loved ones and early critics\rand business partners. Webby Award (considered as Oscar of Internet)\rbeing techie kept it simple \u0026mdash; as they have \u0026ldquo;5 word Acceptance\rSpeeches” rule.

I was determined to be\rregular with Coach Kothandapani K C and Pacemakers group. Earlier, was\rjust running once a week with the group on weekend for long run and that\rtoo bit irregular. Now for one month started to leave home at 4:30 AM to\rreach Kanteerava Stadium for Tuesday and Thursday training. Tuesday, is\rinterval training something I never ever tired before when I started to\rrun, in early 2000. I struggled for weeks but eventually saw some\rimprovement in me but there is still a lot to go. Thursdays we do tempo\ror core strengthening exercise which really helps running as core is the\rpower house of our body. And couple of Nandi hill runs on the weekend\rensured we were not scared of those flyovers in upcoming Airtel\rHyderabad Half Marathon .\nIn recent time, asked my younger brother to ship a pair of running\rshoes (4E-wide feet) \u0026amp; Garmin(GPS Watch). These items were personally\rcarried to Bangalore by friends and colleague from US. These items are\rnot easily available in India and if they are, they cost an arm and leg.\nCan not thank enough Pamela for being there like a rock. Now a days,\rPamela rushes faster than Bolt on those 2 days as she prepares\rbreakfast, lunch box and ensures Aarush and herself is ready with\rshower, breakfast and out of home by 07:30 to be at school on time.\rAlso, in recent time lucky to have family members around who\rbaby-seated Aarush on Saturdays as we are now running on Saturdays for\rlong run instead of Sundays.\nThe result just speak for itself, finished Hyderabad Half Marathon\rstrong with 2:01:33 on my Garmin. It is my best in recent time and I am\rhappy with the split timing for each Kilometers. I was consistent\rthroughout and had only few kilometers where I ran slower than pace 6.\rThe last KM I was able to push myself and was around 5:10 pace again ;\rwhere crossed a fellow runner from the running group and felt like\rwinning the Gold medal. Yes, there was hard work, determination,\rstrategy which helped me to achieve this. A minute shorter would have\rbeen a icing on the cake. But again, all these could not have been\rpossible without these people and their belief in me; so feeling really\rblessed.\n\nThe race was an amazing one, met few finest Indian runners from other\rcities. The arrangement of transport, train tickets, hotel arrangement\rwas too good; again special thanks to Coach and pacemakers team for\rthat. The post-run lunch was something which I am going to drool and\rtalk about for months to come. It was a unmarked restaurant named \u0026ldquo;Dine\rHill\u0026rdquo;, we were bit hesitant\rinitially but once went inside for food; seeing the people and their\rplates we got a big cultural shock. There were those huge dishes which\rare as big as the size of the table and 4-5 people eat together from the\rsame plate. We asked the restaurant guy if he is going to give us\rseparate plate; He said YES but added why do not you try this way of\rsharing and eating food with friends - love grows between friends. \n\n\n\n","excerpt":"Blessing is a simple word, but yesterday night (Monday) just before\rsleeping I was thinking about the same again and again.

The last time I traveled in 1stclass was\rearly 1985 when we went to Puri ( a must stop for Bengali\r).\rSo when the dates for summer vacation became clear started booking for\rtrain tickets. It was month of December when we booked ticked for April.\rWanted to book 2ndAC ticket but to my surprise it was\ralready sold out so opted for AC 1stClass. The price of AC\r1stclass is almost like air-fare on a positive side you get\ra personal cabin/coupe and great food and service but it still takes\rlooong time to travel between Bangalore and Calcutta. It takes 2.5 hours\rin flight and 28 hours in the fastest train which is called as Duronto\r(quick). We wished to get a coupe for ourselves as when you book a AC\r1stClass ticket you don’t get a seat number like other class\rjust till 4 hours of train departure that is when Railway prepares the\rboarding chart. Doing few search on internet one gentleman suggested the\rbest way to get a coupe to yourselves is go to the boarding railway\rstation and get a special ticket for your pet for a minimal price. Now\rthat way Railway will not mix you with others and on the day of journey\ryou can always say you left behind your pet with a friend.\nThe Journey: \nThe day of journey started with two unpleasant news. The first one maid\rcalled up to inform that she is not coming. Oh! that was hard, Pamela\rhad to clean the house, utensils to her best as she was leaving for\ralmost 4 weeks. And the second was rash on Aarush back. Hmm not a great\rstart as we were not sure what the hell is this. The pre-booked taxi\rcame well before hand and to our surprise we reached Yashwantpur in\rjiffy. We had to wait for an hour before boarding the train which was\runpleasant with heat but a good warm-up session for the hottest summer\rahead as we leave Bangalore.\nThe train started on time and we were greeted with red roses and wet\rtissue from the greeting staff. Soon they gave water bottles and told us\rthey will be serving soup soon and checked if we need anything before\rthat. The food was great and it was served with proper cutlery and there\rwas foldable tables. They even came back to check if we need any extra\ritem while having lunch. We had Indian Lunch and continental dinner and\rin between he had snacks, tea-coffee and soups.\nThe journey was really relaxing the way I wanted till we reached Cuttack\r(Orissa) next day, where our train and other trains including Rajdhani\rwere stuck for 2 hours as there was protest from local people demanding\rone over-bridge. This two hours delay just killed all the fun, as soon\rpassenger started to agitate and there was a big drama when people were\rcomplaining we in 1stAC still enjoying AC while they are not\rJ. But the reality was we did not but as AC-1st class are cabins and\rhave less people it was getting hot slowly. But again that reminded us\rof Calcutta which is synonymous with agitation all the time. Over the\ryears people of Bengal have really do not know how to take ownership and\rlead to solve problem of their own they are always blaming someone. Any\rway after all that we started for Calcutta and soon it was lunch time.\nWell we reached a rain soaked Calcutta post dark, it was relief from\rheat but took a long time to reach our pre-booked hotel at central\rCalcutta. A journey we will cherish long time as not sure next when I am\rgoing to have the luxury of time.\n","excerpt":"It was a dream from a long time to travel in 1stclass in\rIndian Railway.

It was the first run\rout of Bangalore for me. Last time I registered for Mumbai Standard\rChartered was in 2008 and was gifted with Aarush just few days before\rthe race :D Well Aarush is the reason why I can not run on weekdays\rmorning but he is the catalyst who introduced me to The Pacemakers\rrunning group of Bangalore.\n It was a great escape for me from Bangalore and daily routine. a big\rthanks to Pamela for supporting me on this. Knew it was not going to be\rmy best run given the fact I was not practicing at all. The last time\rran was beginning of June after that it was all about running around\rhousehold and office work. Working late and on weekends and busy with\rAarush\u0026rsquo;s school and what not. In fact I was so messed up posted The\rPacemakers Facebook page that “I am not going” but thanks to Pamela\rafter an hour posted “I will” be going.\n\nThanks to fellow runners a cab was booked and woke up Saturday Morning\rat 4:30 and meet them at the gate at 5. We were at Containment Station\rby 5:40 where already few fellow runners were waiting, at 6:10 boarded\rthe Shatabdi. The train journey was fun brought back the memory of\rcollege days where traveled in a large group for the last time. It was\rfun to be noisy and so many small group chit chat \u0026hellip; it was real\rentertaining.\nAs soon reached Chennai the humid heat welcomed us and oh! that smell of\rChennai Central. Thanks to our Tamil friends we moved to the electrical\r(local) train platform and took a local train towards hotel, the last\rpart from station to hotel was long walk . We crossed many ministerial\rbungalows as walked from Station to our hotel Raj Palace.\nReaching hotel there was enough opinions for lunch venue/cuisine between\r30+ hungry stomachs personally stayed back had the same in the hotel and\rhad a long nap till dark. It was ladies Final at Wimbledon and soon our\rroom was packed with 20+ people as it is more fun to watch in group.\rEveryone thought it would be a big fight between German and French. But\rBartoli finished the tournament quickly in a straight set with ace. Well\rshe did not beat any big names in this tournament but she beat those who\rdid \u0026hellip; a dream came true.\nDinner was like lunch again many opinion and this time personally went\rout to explore little beyond hotel to ‘Saravana\rBhavan’ the place was\rpacked as usual and had Paneer Dosa a foolish choice before a long run\rtried to mitigate with Dahi Vada (yogurt to neutralize the richness of\rCottage Cheese and oil) . The bus ride back to hotel was long we had we\rhad a walk mile personally liked it after a big meal.\nRace Day …. Woke\rup at 3:30 had a quick shower and realized it is going to be a tough one\ras was not feeling good in stomach. We were supposed to be out of hotel\rby 4 but there was big time drama by the arranged cab drivers, was part\rof the last drop. The sky was dark with cloud and it rained a lot in the\rnight but still the weather felt hot and very very humid bay around\r75~85% precipitation. Tried to follow Coach’s warm-up session but the\rschool ground was full of sand and dropped out from the running one. The\rrace started at 5 and started my stop watch for the first time running\rwith a watch and that too a GPS enabled, started with few pacemakers\rfor the first few kilometers and then started running of my own pace\rwhich felt very good about. And every Kilometers Garmin showed my speed\rand all was looking very nice. Soon say the lead runner coming back and\rit was none other than our Nanjundappa. The second runner was at least a\rKM behind him. Soon saw many of the Pacemakers taking the turn. But my\rrun took a downhill as I struggled from 13KM onwards. I felt there are\rtoo much water in my bladder and I am tired from the humid condition. So I walked run and continued till the end and many people crossed me in\rthat process. The 2 KM I tried again to push myself but by that time I\rwas out. As soon as I finished the race said bye to pacemakers group and\rwalked back to hotel. Well it was a long walk but did not want to haggle\rwith Autos.\nThe race was very organized with lots of police and volunteers and roads\rare so good that it does not seem like India. The coarse was also\rperfect as we ran along Bay of Bengal and the famous Marina Bay only\rhumidity was a concern but there is no way we can avoid that in this\rtime of the year. The sun was completely out as sky was covered with\rdark cloud I think it can not be better than this in July in Chennai.\n\nReaching Hotel, freshened up had a big breakfast and by that time all\rothers also came back. There was a celebration in hotel where someone\rwalked and got beers personally skipped beer just after exercise but\rthe fun was too good to be missed. The train journey back was as much\rfun but this time everyone was little bit tired. Enjoyed every moment of\rthis trip and next is one going to be Hyderabad Half Marathon in late\rAugust. Well the result below is wrong to my it will be in the range of\r2:27.

We tried\rSumerSands the\rnumber-Uno destination for Managlore on travel. Now a resort with\rprivate beach was actually made for Expats community.\nWe started from Bangalore at 5 AM Sharp this time after loading the car\rwith bags and baggage previous night. We were running low with cash but\ropted to find an ATM along the road and left Bangalore in hurry. This\rtime road to Nilmangala via Yashwantpur was more pleasant compared to\rlast week and soon we were on NH 48. Till Kunigal the road is now a\rproper 4 Lanes with tool. We paid toll twice on this part of the road\rbut I was not complaining as I was doing constant 110/120 Km/Hr. The\rroad from Hassan was old undivided two lanes. But as we left early we\rdid not face any traffic and we were soon near Sakleshpur. It was only\r7:45 and I could not believe myself that we crossed 223 KM in 2:30\rhours in Indian road.\n\nWe stopped for ATM and got the dough, but missed the petrol pump next\rdoor. After breakfast, we wanted to fill fuel as the fuel needle was\rtouching “E”. but to our surprise we crossed the small town of\rSakleshpur and was already started the famous Shiradi Ghat\rsection. Soon we realized our mobile phones are out of network,\rpanicked little bit as there was no way to find out how far is the next\rpetrol station. Switched off the AC to gain one/two Kilometers of extra\rmillage. The road condition detoriated as the pot holes got bigger and\rbigger. The fuel needle was touching “E” but luckily the LED did not\rglow constantly. It became ON once or twice. We asked few groups of\rtruck drivers and their answer were very promising. The milestones\rwere not that comforting as they did not tell us how far we are from Gas\rStation.\nSoon we crossed a forest check post, and we asked how far is the petrol\rstation and got the best news the next one only couple of KM away. And\rjust like that the Ghat section ended we filled full tank and headed for\rMangalore. There was long queue for paying 5 Rupees Toll just outside\rMangalore but with that we still managed to reach Managalore city by\r11:30. Nokia’s GPS was very accurate and we reached the major landmark\r(Hampankatta Circle) near our Saffron Boutique Hotel but from there it\rtook another 10-15 minutes to reach there.\nThe hotel was great , newly renovated and we had a simple veg. lunch\rthere. But the temperature and humidity was a killer and we decided for\ra nap.\nAfter nap we drove towards Ullal ( 10KM south ) from Mangalore for\rSummer Sands. We reached soon and it was very hot at 16:00. They\rcharged us 100 INR per person at the gate and gave us some snacks\rvoucher. Aarush was very impatient to get into the water. But after\rspending some time in the shade eating the snacks me and Aarush changed\rand got into the water. The beach being private was clean but it is very rough where no one ventured to go inside deep water, as back wave\rwas really dangerous. I needed to keep an constant eye on Aaursh, as few\rtimes he got drifted from his seating place with the wave. He really played a lot; was not happy to get out.\nBut now when he got out we were worried what to give for dinner as it\rwas only 19:00. Dinner was not ready before 19:30 but with request the\rresort was able to serve us food little early and we had a quick\rdinner for ourselves. On the way back, I had to stop in front of a shop\rwhich had street light to check my rear bumper which was making little\rsound. The shop owner was true “Good Samaritan” fixed the bumper for\rfree using his indigenous skills and technique which really lasted long.\nNext morning, after breakfast we left for North direction driving past\rManagalore port, Chemical factory and major refinery. We drove to Panambur beach first, the beach was OK OK nothing great. There is one\rlight house with little shacks. After that we crossed Surathkal\r(KREC, Alma matter of my younger brother) according to guidebook\rSurathkal beach is one of the clean and hidden gem of Mangalore but we\rskipped it for Udupi. Udupi is famous for it Krishna Temple and during\rnoon you get Prasad as whole meal. Udupi and its cuisine can be found\racross India famous for vegetarian dishes. The direction to temple was\rclear but as we approached, the road got narrower and parking became\rdifficult. After parking the car in a designated parking lot we walked\rto reach the temple. The Sun was a real killer. There was some queue in\rthe temple but not very long. After paying our homage to Lord Krisha we\rwere waiting for the special Prasad and after 40 minutes or so\runderstood there was no Prasad that day as it was ‘Ekadashi (eleventh\rday of moon calendar).\nWe came out of the temple and walked back to car and not sure what to do\rnext. We were hungry but the Sun and heat suggested stay inside only. So\rafter deliberation headed for Malpe beach. We missed the sign for beach\rand took a detour around Maple jetty oh! boy there was the smell of\rfish. There was one nice big resort called Paradise. We stopped there\rhad a long lunch intentionally and ordered desert and cold drinks in\rsteps just to kill time we almost sat there for 3 hours. At last around\r4 headed for the beach.\nThe beach was crowded but soon we realized this has one of the best\r‘white –sand’ we have been to. The waves were more gentle compared to\rits southern cousin and there were many adventure activities going on.\rYou can go up in the parachute ride, the banana ride and water jet. Me\rand Aarush enjoyed a long stay in the warm water. Once it started to\rget dark we left the beach and headed towards the car. We could not even\rleave Malpe when the thunderstorm hit us. It was heavy rain with\rlighting. It caused havoc on the road. We continued driving and probably\rthe worst rain driving for me. Ultimately, stopped and pull over as it\rwas little scary to drive behind red lights of other car with no\rvisibility of the general road. But any way we could not stop for ever\n so after 10/15 minutes started and continued driving. We reached a\rrain soaked Mangalore quite late. Took an Auto from Hotel after getting fresh and headed for a small fast\rfood place called “Hot Bitez” Oppsite Canara College on Jail Road.\rWe picked this place from a blog with a catchy\rtitle . Well, the\rfood was OK OK with fries and burger you can be never be wrong with\rAarush, On our way back we enjoyed the festival of “Dusherra rally”\rwhere children to adult dress up like tiger and they are accompanied by\rdrums and music. It is like a carnival. They start from the city center\rand go around. The party starts around midnight and last till wee hours\rof the morning. We were tired to enjoy this for long. But it was a shame\rof not having DSLR with us to capture the color and expression at that\rtime.\nNext day, after a breakfast we drove down south again and this time we\rdrove for 70 KM south and visit the famous Bekal fort in Kerala. The\rfort was built around 1650 over 40 acres of land. In recent time it got\rprominent when famous director Mani Ratnam shoot his mega film\rBombay in early nineties. A very beautiful fort with many watch\rtowers, with breath taking view of Arabian sea as we walked along the\rparameters.\nIt was a holiday on the occasion of Id, complete Kerala was closed.\rWe made a big fool of ourselves by not having food at Bekal Fort before\rleaving from there. We reached Summersand again and had a late\rlunch there. After spending time on beach we opted to leave early and\rhave a proper dinner in Mangalore city. We asked our hotel reception to\rsuggest a Mangalorian restaurant and they suggested one. We went by auto\rand the place was nice, crowded with families waiting for their turn. We\rwere really hungry and ordered lots of food. The food came after some\rtime but it was so spicy that Pamela who normally handles hot and spicy\rfood well could not handle too. It was a disaster in simple words,\rAarush was very sleepy and we could not force him much.\nNext day, was our last day in Mangalore and we started slow. We visited\rthe famous ‘St. Aloysius\rChapel”\rwhich is inside a educational campus. There are beautiful stained glass\rand the floor is simply awesome with mosaic. We went by auto and after\rspending sometime went to picture butterfly in near by Tagore park.\rAfter that we just walked back towards our hotel . We stopped at the\rfamous Ideal Ice\rCream Parlor and tried\rtheir famous “Gadbad”. Aaursh really liked it as it was his\rbreakfast and soon we ordered the **Dilkush, **after the big ice-creams\rwe headed back to our room, packed our things, payed the bill and\rstarted for Bangalore.\nThis time our tank was full when we cross Ghat section but as we crossed\rit around mid-day there were traffic and driving uphill had its own fun\ron those curves. Just after crossing Chikmanglur town we stopped for\rlunch. It was very crowded. Post lunch we drove straight to Bangalore\rwithout any stop.\n","excerpt":"As mentioned we split the travel in\rOctober\rwith a week in between at Bangalore Durga Pooja. The destination for\rpart two had to have sea and beach to cleansing the body and soul.\rPersonally more of sea person if I have to choose between hills \u0026amp; sea. We settled for Mangalore. We booked for one hotel in the city which had\rmaximum discount for 3 nights. We tried\rSumerSands the\rnumber-Uno destination for Managlore on travel.","ref":"https://santm.com/blog/2013-03-04-mangalore/","title":"Mangalore"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/mani-ratnam/","title":"Mani Ratnam"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/maple-jetty/","title":"Maple jetty"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/panambur-beach/","title":"Panambur beach"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/saffron-boutique-hotel/","title":"Saffron Boutique Hotel"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/st.-aloysius-chapel/","title":"St. Aloysius Chapel"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/sumersands/","title":"sumersands"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/surathkal-beach/","title":"Surathkal beach"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/udupi/","title":"Udupi"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/adil-shahi-dynasty/","title":"Adil Shahi dynasty"},{"body":"Day-5, Woke up at 4:30 in the morning as I could barely sleep whole\rnight. Had mu bath and got little bit packing down to ensure we leave\rBijapur at the earliest. Woke Pamela \u0026amp; Aarush around 5:30 and we started\rto walk to Gol Gumbaz. Unfortunately the lady who manages the ticket\rcounter did not show up till 6:30. We were the first one to enter. After\rthe local guard gving us little more history lesson asked us to climb\rthe steps quickly before anyone. We climbed the seven story building\rusing medieval steps which gets steeper as you climb. Aarsush did a\rgreat job of climbing all by himself. We were the only one at thw\rwhispering gallery and able to whisper between ourselves across the\rhall. It is a amazing feeling of hearing the slightest of sound across\rfootball field. But after 10 minutes of so we got lousy intruders and we\rcalled it a go. Climbing down was more difficult at times.\n\nReaching hotel we had breakfast and Aarush and Pamela took shower and by\r9 headed out for Bangalore. The drive was again on newly constructed\rNH-13 and by 11 we reached Hospect. We did not stopped and continued\rdriving and by 13:30 reached Chitradurga. We first tried Hotel Aishwarya\rFort which was just a dignified bar bar and bar. We left it as me and\rAarush even could not use their rest room. We came to Naveen Regency\rwhich was a pleasant surprise. The hotel was clean and there was no\rdrinking in the restaurant which made it more comfortable.\nAfter a nice lunch we headed for ‘Chitradurga Fort’ – Chitra(picture)\rdurga(fort). This fort was built between 10-18th centuries by different\rrulers and at last post independence it was part of Mysore dynasty\rbefore handing over to Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). As it was\rweekday there were hardly any tourist there. Once we entered the fort\rone guide approached us and after little bargain he agreed to be our\rguide.\nAs the fort was built over many centuries it was like a mini town within\rthe fort itself. There are many layers of walls to cross to reach the\rfort entry. To minimize any attack there are sharp turns, narrow but\rstrong doors which can withstand attack from charging elephants. We kept\ron climbing as we explored the beauty and history. After a climb of\r40/45 minutes we reached a plateau where there are the main temple and\rswing area.\nFrom there we again climbed down to go to the back side of the fort. The\rback side of the fort is not that fortified. But it has natural\rboundaries. And most attack on th fort has been on the front as the\raccessibility is very poor. The attraction is “Onake Obavva”, where one\rlady managed to kill many soldiers of Hyder Ali as they tried to enter\rfrom the back. You can read it all here.(\rhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onake_Obavva)\nNow after many steps and ups and downs Aarush was tired and so are we. A\rday of climbing steps with history which started in morning in Bijapur.\rWe started around 5 PM for Bangalore and did not make any stop as we\rmissed one decent Kamat near Tumkur L . The traffic was horrible as\rusual and it got only worse as we approached home. We stopped at\rMcDonald just in-front of our home as Aaursh was not happy with this\rtrip at all .. all the temples .. daemons and mythological figures. Any\rway it was a long drive on the last day but very much doable.\n","excerpt":"Day-5, Woke up at 4:30 in the morning as I could barely sleep whole\rnight.

Bansankari has lady idol with eight hands which\ris worshiped meticulously around. We saw one lady rolling herself around\rthe whole temple periphery with wet cloth which signifies she just took\ra bath in the nearby holy-pond. We got a good darshan of the devi idol\ras there was not much crowd in the morning.\nWe came to hotel and waited for our breakfast which was bit late as we\rwoke up early. After breakfast we headed for the Badami caves. Badami\rhas 4 caves inspired by Ellora. There are lots of monkeys in the base\rand cave-1 (dedicated to lord Shiva). You must not carry any food or\rwater bottle, we got ourself a guide who has been in this business for\rlast 20 years and he explained in details each cave and allowed us\renough time to take plenty of pictures. Though the objects are same as\rwe have seen in Hampi, Aihole and Patadkal but as they curved them out\rof the rock and created temple in cave formed these objected remained in\rbetter shape as at least they are saved from direct rain.\n\nOnce we completed all the caves we took our car through the busy market,\rI just stopped at times for few minutes before moving another inch as\rthere was no space on both ends. Somehow we reached the Bhutanatha\rtemple again Aarush opted for staying in car and we quickly went around\rthe temple.\nWe came to hotel to checkout and hotel guys suggested we should go to\rMahakuta temple before headed in towards Bijapur. This is a Shiva Temple\rand there is a pond which is considered quite holy to take a dip. After\rspending a short time there we headed towards to Bijapur directly\rskipping lunch.\nThe afternoon sun was hot like last two days and we continued nonstop to\rBijapur( 120 KM). Personally was not very favorable about this choice as\rthought of having a lunch at Badami before heading towards the\rhighway. Anyway reached Bijapur and we opted for Hotel Pearl on Station road. The\rhotel is a very basic one and does not carry any recommendation, some\rwebsites and friends mentioned about Hotel Madhuvan were we did enquire\rfrom Bangalore. Any way after a quick checkin we headed towards the\rattractions of Bijapur.\nWe started with Jod Gumbaz (twin tomb) and from there we went to Ibrahim\rRauza. As we were shooting photograph one guide appeared to offer his\rservice. We agreed for a town wide tour with whatever can be covered in\rthe remaining sun light. It was good to have him in the car as we did\rnot have to ask for any direction every non and then and moved from one\rattraction to another. We covered Malik-e-Maidan(the great canon),\rBarakaman, Jami Masjid , Taj Bawdi, Mehtar Mahal, Asar Mahal. The only\rkey attraction that was left was Gol Gumaz and guide told us the history\rand asked us to get up early in the morning to get good experience of\rthe same.\nHe left us around 6 PM next to the Barakaman in one restaurant where we\rthree tired and hungry person waited for their service to start at 7.\rAaursh did his best had some food and we also quickly finished our food\rand headed to hotel. There was no hot water anymore and we were told it\rwill start again in the morning 4.

The highway NH-13 between Hospet and\rBijapur is recently widen to 4 lane. It was a pleasure driving, the road\rwas not at all crowded and surprisingly the trucks maintained the left\rlane. Was driving around 110/120 KMph without any trouble and soon\rreached Hungund. From there we took left turn towards Aihole.\n\nThere are plenty of sign for Aihole but when we reached we were greeted\rwith a rustic village. There was no guides or local man asking us and by\rmistake we crossed the village and started with Jain Temple which is\rlocated on the isolated back side of the hill.\nFrom there we came to village and visited – Hucchappayya Math Complex,\rMallikarjuna Complex, Ravana Pahdi \u0026amp; Hucchimalli temple complex. Aarush\rhad little snack while the car was under a tree shade. But the sun again\rwas too hot and scotching hot. All these places we were the only visitor\rmost of the times.\nFrom there we went to Durga temple complex – the key attraction of\rAihole. This time we found guide and after little bargain we hired one.\rAfter 90 minutes of tour we called it a day in Aihole.\nThe construction \u0026amp; sculpture at Aihole is considered the basic or\rprimary for Karnataka. This is the very place where people inspired by\rEllora started their love affair with stone.\nFrom there we took the road towards Patadkal. The roads is a typical\rvillage road and the sun was very hard on us. We reached there around\r15:00; we did not had any proper lunch as there was no suitable place\ralong the road to stop. We waited in the car had little more snacks \u0026amp;\rfruits that we had with us. We got in to the UNESCO Heritage site around\r15:30 when the shadow got little longer. We hired a guide and without\rhim the true beauty and history of this place would have remained\runknown to us. There are seven temples dedicated mostly to Lord Shiva.\rOther than one remaining six is not functional as either the idol is\rbroken or missing. The key of Patadakal is unique mix of South and North\rIndian temples. After 2 hours of trip down the memory lane we called it\ra day and left for Badami. As soon as we came out of the main temple\rcomplex we found the lone Jain temple on our right hand side and we did\ra quick stop there.\nThe road to Badami with orange sunlight with the backdrop of hills was\rvery beautiful. The rocks were glowing with soft sunlight. We reached\rBadami before sunset and ordered some coffee and snacks as we reached\rour hotel Badami Court.\nDinner was a simple one, and after a long day we hit the bed early.\nPictures from\rPattadkal\n","excerpt":"Day-3, post breakfast we hit the road, this time we followed the GPS\rvoice of Pamela’s Lumia more attentively and with ease we head out of\rHospet and join the highway.

After that the traffic got better but there were too many\rdiversions as there was work going on to build flyovers and road\rwidening on NH-4. We filled fuel somewhere after Nelamangala, and\rnoticed there were not many decent stops like CCD or others. We did make\ra quick stop after one of those toll-plaza before Chitradurga to have\rlunch inside the car with the home cooked paratha (stuffed bread).\nAt Chitradurga we need to take an diversion and left NH-4 and continued\ron NH-13 (Solapur Highway). This is a undivided 2 lane road. There are\rnot many small vehicles but lots of big rigs. We found lots of Sunflower\rfield and stopped in one of them for a quick photo-shoot. The road is\rfull of pot holes and unmarked speed breakers. But it was not that bad\rand I got used to it after a while and reached outskirts of Hospet\raround 4PM. There we saw the many mining dump-truck but this is just a\rsmall part compared to its neighbor Bellary.\nFinding our destination Hotel Malligey was easy as it is quite well\rknown, we checked in before dusk. The room were very spacious and we\rwere welcomed by very friendly staff there. After getting freshen up we\rfixed a guide from hotel’s travel desk for next day. Initially we\rplanned for 3 nights stay with 2 days of Hampi but Hotel people\rsuggested we could shorten one day. Later realized it was a good idea as\rone gets bore with stone after a while. But if you are coming from a\rdistance it might be a good idea to spend second day as there are many\rsights to cover.\n\nDay – 2, We started with complementary breakfast from hotel towards\rHampi as our guide was waiting near his village. We picked him up and\rstarted with “Pattabhi Ram Mandir” . From there we went to “Vittala\rTemple” via “Talarigatta Gate”. From the car park there are golf cart\rwhich takes you to Vittala Temple (around 2 KM) via the historic market\rarea. Tough it was just 10 on the watch but the Sun was too bright and\rhot. Our guide did a good job in explaining the details. From there we\rproceed to Royal Center.\nWe started with Saraswathi Temple, it was only us in this less visited\rtemple. Next to it was Octagonal Bath, a place used by horse traders and\rother outsider. After that we came to Queen Bath a unique mix of Indian\r\u0026amp; Persian architecture. Each dome is designed differently. The\rperipheral verandah provided the required shade and privacy for royal\rwomen.\nThe ‘Mahanavami Dibba’ is a huge area with many sites within the key is\roff-course Dassara platform. The kings of Hampi used to celebrate\rDassara a big way currently royal family Mysore celebrate the same.\rAarush became bored with stones and fatigued with so hot sun, he\rpreferred to stay in the car to play ‘angry bird’ ?\nAfter this we moved our car to ‘Hazara Rama Temple’ a royal temple which\rdepicts the Indian epic Ramayana on stone wall. This was a temple only\rfor royal family to pray and enter. There is ‘Archeology Gallery and\rOffice; which we skipped and headed straight to ‘Zenana(ladies)\rEnclosure’ . The key attraction inside is offcourse ‘elephant stable’\rand ‘lotus mahal’ another key thing to notice is the watch towers. Each\rof them are different- one is circular and other one triangular. Now it\rwas almost 12:30 and we agreed to stop for lunch and have a good break\rto avoid the sun which was really too hot to handle.\nThe number uno destination for food in Hampi is Mango Tree – a\rvegetarian place next to the Tungabhadra River under giant mango tree.\rYou get all kinds of food which is a delicacy given the remoteness of\rHampi. The best part was we ordered in parts to linger our stay in\rshade.\nAt around 3/3:30 we started again, and there is a road which connects to\rVirupaksha Temple. But looks like it is kind of private road where our\rguide opened a huge gate next to Mango Tree to let us in. Virupaksha\rtemple is still a working temple and you will find Laxmi , the temple\relephant there. After Virupaksha temple we crossed Hampi bazaar and\rdrove uphill to Kadalekalu Ganesha. This is known as Hemakunta hill\rwhere many attraction can be covered on foot. But we skipped it as that\rwould mean we have climb down the hill to Hampi Bazar again.\nFrom there we went to Laxmi Narayan and Badavilinga temple. We drove\rpast the famous two storied gateway. A perfect place to enjoy sunset\ramong glowing granites. We headed to Krishna Temple and on route saw\r‘Akka Tangi Gudda’ (sister stone) two giant boulders forming an arch. We\rvisited underground Shiva temple next and noblemen quarter.\nThe sun was now dropping and we had a dilemma what to do next, our guide\rsuggested we visit one more temple not so visited by tourist due to its\rofftrack location. The temple is Pattabhirama Temple a huge temple with\rstone carvings are still intact. We should have went to ‘Hemakunta hill’\rto watch sun set but instead headed to Tungabhadra reservoir and got\rlost in Hospet town. It was a long day and Aarush went to sleep so\rheaded to hotel.\nLots of stone, art and history at the end it at times feel heavy on head\rreminding touring Louvre museum of Paris for a whole day.\n","excerpt":"Day – 1, As planned we left Bangalore quite late in our standard\rafter a big breakfast at home around 11, the traffic on a Saturday as\rusual was very heavy and it continued that way till we crossed\rNelamangala.

This road goes via tea gardens and gives a treat to your eyes.\rOnce we reached Coonoor we parked next to the bus stand and had a quick\rthali lunch in nearby busy restaurant. After that we headed towards our\rFarmstay - Wild Acre. The direction given by Mr. Mansoor is very\raccurate and we reached without any trouble. The location is just back\rof Coonoor bus stand and very well marked.\n\nAfter putting our stuffs and a small introduction of the cheese and farm\rand its produce from Deepak we went out to explore Coonoor. We went to\rthe botanical garden which has trees from all over the world. We must\radmire those British for bringing tree or plant from faraway places and\rmaking themselves feel at home far away from their motherland. Be it\rShillong (summer capital of Assam in British days) or Coonoor, they have\rsimilarities with parks, lakes well planned roads in hills and old\rBritish Bungalows. Coming back to the botanical garden, it is well\rmaintained but Indian common culture of eating and playing cricket\ranywhere and everywhere within the park will surely take a toll slowly\ron the green patches.\nAarush demanded to take a boat ride and as he was upset about leaving\rRedHill behind ; we managed to get our turn quickly as there was no\rproper queue for boating. It took 10 minutes to complete the\rpaddling.And after some photo shoots of here and there we left the\rbotanical garden behind.\nNext we drove through Wellington – a Indian Army Area. The whole area is\runder Indian Army and they have officer training camp and many other\rtraining facilities. Also there is a golf course which is really worth\rits name. After driving cluelessly we headed back to Acre Wild. We went\rdown from our cottage to main dining area for dinner around 8 and\rliterally forced them to cook on time. The food was OK, the quality and\rservice was on the negative side. Though Mr. Monsoon appeared briefly\rand promised he will join ; but after many minutes of waiting and as\rfood was getting cold we had our dinner and told them again and again to\rkeep the breakfast ready for next day on time.\n\nNext day we woke up around 7.00am and took morning walk through the farm\rand some picture shots of birds and surrounding scenic area before we\rwent for breakfast. The breakfast included freshly baked bread and farm\rmade cheese. It was much better than dinner we must admit. We met\ranother family from Bangalore who were visiting Coonoor for the second\rtime. We shared our previous night dinner experience and it seems they\rhad the same on their first night and opted for self prepared dinner.\nWe had a big plan to ride the World Heritage Blue rail from Coonoor to\rOoty and visit Ooty city and comeback. The railway station is a small\rone and parking was a nightmare as there were many many taxi, vans\rwaiting for tourist coming in the peak of summer vacation. We booked the\rticket of 1st class train ticket. And Parking attendee told me to wait\rand park once parking lots get little free after all passengers came to\rCoonoor moves out. It sound simple but it was not so\u0026hellip;.it was too\rcongested and as I was driving backwards; scratched my bumper and\reveryone was honking at me. In mean time, Pamela was calling to tell the\rtrain is about to leave.\nIn that process I missed the train and had to drive from Connor to Ooty\rwhile Aarush and Pamela went by train. Pamela \u0026amp; Aarush were really\rupset, Aarush cried whole way thinking his dad was lost\u0026hellip;.. it was\rtotal disaster.Now after driving from Conoor to Ooty (via the main\rhighway this time) was waiting at the railway station. Pamela appeared\runhappy with the situation but looking at car dent she didn\u0026rsquo;t had\ranything else to say.\nHaving own car was bliss on other side, we reached botanical garden of\rOoty to start with but with rotten mood. This time parking was OK and as\rwe were taking a stroll within garden it started to rain. We took\rshelter in the glass house. After botanical garden we drove to Ooty\rmain market from there we came to Café Coffee Day for a break and it\rrained again. Lucky us, we dodged the rain twice. We saw tourists\rdrenched in the sudden rain and shivering in cold.\nWe had a late lunch at XXX and bought the famous Ooty chocolate from\rking\u0026rsquo;s Star.\nAfter that we went to Rose Graden, by this time we could feel the\rchillness in Ooty’s air after the rain as day was coming to an end.\rAfter taking a full round of the rose garden we headed back to Coonoor.\rThe Rose Garden is really big and has many varieties of rose from\rJapanese green to black rose.\nWe bought some packets of Maggi before entering Acre Wild. It was\rraining like dogs and cat as we had self prepared dinner. It was a day\rwhich ended with high note as we had our car and saved from rain.\nNext day the breakfast was again a disappointment as no cheese no fresh\rbread. It was simple plain toast and omelet. Mrs. Mansoor joined us for\rbreakfast as both the guest were leaving for Banglore. May be she was\rthere to ensure we settled our bills properly or not. Any way I would\rnot rate this place for hospitality. They have functional kitchen,\rclean bathroom and it is your choice to stay there or not. May be coming\rout of a great hospitality of Red Hills our expectation was high as we\rread many positive comments in travel forum and blogs.\nBefore heading back to Ooty we went around Wellington one more time.\rCrossing Ooty with traffic reminded us of reality. Traffic police tried\rtheir best to prevent us from going via the shortest route (36 hairpin\rbend). But we convinced them we will drive slow and maintain 2nd gear\rall along. Coming down a steep hill is always riskier than going up but\rwe just followed the rules mentioned on the road. We drove in 2nd gear,\rno speeding, no overtaking and following lane.\nWe stopped Popeye\u0026rsquo;s at Masinagudi, it is a fast food center with French\rFires and burgers \u0026amp; wraps. The place is clean and has a clean toilet the\rfood is decent and run by a lovely couple. What else to ask in the\rmiddle of nowhere.\nWe came across few tuskers of forest department as we cross Masinagudi\rjungle range. We did not stopped around Mysore and finally stopped at\rCafé Coffee Day for a refreshment.\n","excerpt":"We followed road suggested by Mr. Vijay to reach Coonoor, which was\rquite deserted except few local people we were the only one on that\rroad.

We were the only guest during lunch time, the food\rwas Indian freshly made and tasty. Post lunch it was dark sky as we\rreturned to our room for a siesta and it started to rain. It was a\rpleasure to enjoy the rain only from the hill top. Rain made it even\rmore pristine with each leaves shining after talking bath. Once Aarush\rwoke up he found his newly found best friend waiting for him. It is\rGerman Sheppard named Moby who is so friendly that after a while we were\rnot scared that Aarush was almost touching his teeth. While we were\rhaving evening coffee we met another family. They were also from\rBangalore and we mingled up very well. This family of four had 2 boys\rwho became Aarush new hero. And adult had fun chatting while taking a\rstroll. Aarush was happy as it was all boys and “Moby’ the German\rSheppard of Red Hill kept him busy.\nAt evening, temperature started to drop and we enjoyed a lovely\rconversation in front of a working fire place. It is unimaginable when\rwhole India is basking with summer in Middle of April we are seating in\rfront a Fireplace. We planned for next day’s activity with our host.\rDinner served was continental - absolutely great one.

After a good night\rsleep and a healthy breakfast we were all set for the big hike. Mr.\rVijay arranged for the guide and we started to climb up. The climb was\rsteep but best part was Aarush walked most part himself. We took many\rsmall breaks in between to look down at the lakes. After each climb the\rview got better and effort worth it. From the peak you get a panoramic\rview of lakes. When I uploaded picture from my mobile people commented\rwas it ‘Scotland’ ?\n\nAfter climbing down and having our lunch we continued with chit chat.\rMost times as time permitted Mr. \u0026amp; Mrs Vijay joined us. After evening\rtea we left for Parsons Valley Dama and soundings. This time all the\rguest travelled in Mr.Vijay’s Scorpio and the driver drove gently to\rensure spotting wild life.

They are just like normal grey langur in height\rand etc. only deference is body color.\nOn the way back Aarush fall asleep after a full day of activities. And\rwe let him sleep as he was very tired from the long hike and continuous\rrunning with Moby.

We started\rfrom our home around 6:30 AM the traffic in Bangalore-Mysore was as\rusual crazy. Reached Mysore around 9 AM and stopped at Kamat near\rMysore-Zoo for breakfast. From there the road to Masinagudi is 100KM and\rwe had to travel on typical Indian 2 Lane Highway (undivided). The drive\rwas nice only in the last part of Karnataka side there were many\runmarked speed breaker in Bandipur Forest range. On the way we spotted\rmany spotted deers. We reached Masinagudi in high noon with scorching\rheat and filled up the tank with diesel there. The road to JungleHut is\rwell marked and we reached around 12 there.\n\nHost welcomed us with warm greetings and invited Aarush for b’day party\rlater in the evening. Aarush was very keen to jump in the swimming pool\rright then \u0026amp; there and we pursued him for later. The lunch was great\rwith many choice and felt like a great start for vacation. We retired to\rour hut and took a small nap. Around 16:30 we went for a open jeep road\rside safari. We saw many spotted dears on our way to mayor dam. On our\rway back we spotted wild Boar, peacocks; the driver/guide was great and\rhe took us to a detour and we spotted Mongoose and Sambar Deer. Sambar\rDeer was very shy and camouflaged and being dark could not take any\rpicture.\nComing back to JungleHut we found the B’day part just finished but there\rwere cakes and etc. We celebrated the same and got freshened up. The\rdinner was excellent with a touch of continental food. Aarush was very\rhappy as there were many others around his age group and had a good time\rbefore retiring to bed. It was decided next morning Pamela will go for\rwalk into the nearby jungle in the early morning . This track sound very\rpromising as the Sunday Morning people were able to spot a leopard.\nPamela and another lady left for tracking early next morning and they\rspotted one sloth bear just outside the resort. Rest of the track they\rspotted plenty of birds no more luck with big cat. Me \u0026amp; Aarush dipped\rinto the pool and had great fun; being Monday most of the guest left for\rhome and the resort became little deserted. Within the resort we spotted\rwoodpecker and other birds. In the afternoon post lunch we went back to\rBandipur (Karnataka Side) for safari. And were extremely lucky to see\rone sleeping tiger. Apart from these we spotted many dears, peacocks (in\rumpteen no.) wild boar, elephants as well.\nTuesday morning it was my turn for morning jungle safari. I was alone\rwith the guide we spotted sambar deer and others. While trekking we\rcould hear noise of wild animal roaring from very nearby (it seems\ranimal spotted us) but I couldn’t see any.

We did not booked any hotel as\rwe kept everything for last minute. So on the D’day we left basement\rparking around 5AM to avoid Bangalore traffic.And we did hate to\rnavigate rush escaping traffics from Bangalore. We stopped for a quick\rstop after crossing Tamilnadu border to fill the tank and realized\rsomehow fuel tank release was not working. After playing with\rscrewdrivers it finally opened which was a great relief otherwise we\rwould have to wait till 9/10 for a mechanic. As usual stopped at A2B\rbefore Krishnagiri for Breakfast.We crossed Salem town and took the road\rto Yercaud. Soon we were on the hill road which gain altitude quite\rquickly with many twist and 20 sharp hairpins bends. But driving these\r32 KM was fun, The first hotel we enquired for accommodation was GRT but\rthe price they were offering on spot was bit steep for our budget. Bit\rdisappointed there as last night when we checked the same on internet it\rwas showing quite low with discount. May be the GRT guys will save those\roffers for late comers as days come to end. Next we tried Shevaroys\rresort near lake and decided to stay there for the night. This is an old\rlandmark resort in Yercaud. The place is a decent one but would\rrecommend you check on internet before deciding on this.\nWe wanted to visited the famous Botanical Garden but it was closed due\rto weekend (what a weird place who keeps their top destination closed\rfor tourist). May be they do not want any visitors ?. We drove towards\rServarayan temple and Cauvery Point road. On the way Aarush fell asleep\rand we went to Pagoda point. Pagoda gives a nice view of the plain\rbelow. From there we went to Lady\u0026rsquo;s Seat \u0026amp; Gent\u0026rsquo;s Seat .Here, we could\rsee the ghat road from Salem via which we reached Yercaud. We also got\rthe ariel view of GRT hotel. Next to this was Horticulture Farm and it\rhas Rose graden. There was not a single rose as they were freshly\rtrimmed so we have to make ourselfves happy with other green beauties.\nWe came to hotel and it was around 15:00 and went straight for a very\rlate lunch and by this time Aarush also woke up. After lunch we went for\ra small plantation walk within the resort which is pretty nice. Aarush\rhad some fun time in the children\u0026rsquo;s play area. Finally, we entered room;\rgot freshen up \u0026amp; took a beauty sleep and had an early dinner same\revening.\nNext day, we went for a morning walk around lake before breakfast and\rafter breakfast we visited famous Montfort School. This school was\rstarted for anglo-indians around WW-I. The architecture and natural\rbeauty around it is really worth spending some time there. It is a one\rof the convent residential institution in South India. The school was\rhaving admissions test on that day and we could only spot expensive cars\rand anxious parents who were dressed in their best.\nAfter that we returned to room and started for Bangalore. On the way we\rstopped at A2B just after crossing Dharmapuri for lunch. Aaursh was very\rsleepy but he played role of a cranky child all along. After Hosur, we\rforced him to sleep and reached home safely in next hour.\n The NH7 was excellent with many toll plazas which was constantly\remptying my wallet ;) so not sure is it the best hill station or not\rbut definitely it did not felt crowded like Coorg.\n ","excerpt":"Yercaud is mentioned as poor man\u0026rsquo;s Ooty in 52 weekends\rgateway\rbut the article also mention it is a smart choice compared to Ooty.

In the\rafternoon meet-up in person in one part of Bangalore where most who-who\rof Bangalore stay. Somehow luck was not with me and Aarush was sick\rfrom Friday(2nd) evening whom I had to take care for the next\rfew days week at home.\nIt was a viral attack with high fever touching 104 F once or twice a\rday. On Wednesday fever got reduced and doctor gave him some\rantibiotics. So on Thursday 9thwith lots of anxiety left him\rbehind in day care and headed to office where we had a mini-bus waiting\rfor us.\nThe starting point of the trail walk was around 70 KM from Bangalore\rafter Kanakpura next to Sangam. There is one resort where OXFAM\rorganized as starting point and night stay. Being little early and a big\rgroup we were able to push around the organizing committee and lucky\renough to get a isolated two storied building to ourselves.\nNow after 34 hours of walking and many blisters we finished the trail\rwalk and returned to Bangalore like a wounded soldier on Saturday night.\rMy situation was really terrible and had to see a doctor on Monday ; he\rtook a good class of me explaining such extreme should not be tried\rwithout proper training as body releases potassium and that can cause\rkidney failure. Well after a week of rest in bed with elevated feet I\rresumed work on 20th.\n\nThis Trip :\nBut in mean while I was looking for a break with Pamela and Aarush as\rafter Gujrat we never got a chance to get out Bangalore. As Pamela\rworks on Saturdays it is difficult to go anywhere over weekends but\rthen the idea of Anandadham (the Oxfam place) stuck me. I kept it\runder wrap for few days but could not make a complete surprise for\rPamela as few more surprises came our way like a sudden notice of PTA\rfor Aarush on the same Saturday morning.\nSo, on Saturday after PTA, went to Pamela’s school and started for\rKanakpura ; we reached Anandadam around 4.00pm. The place was very quite\ras we were the only guest supposed to spend night there. They served us\rsome snack around 5 and then left for coracle ride on river cauvery. The\rride was great as we spotted many birds ; but the best part was the\rcomplete silence which we enjoyed thoroughly.\nEvening around 6ish electricity was resumed and we returned to our tent\rroom. We were tired but the breeze from river was very refreshing. We\rhad a big dinner and headed for bed early.\nSunday Morning we woke up and had coffee and after that we went for a\r5KM walk to the Vedic School . It was walk via near by forest where\rtermites have eaten the entire forest turning it to hollow trees. After\rwalk we had a big breakfast and then we headed out for some more\ractivities. Found archery a great sport to focus and forget about any\rthing around you. But I chickened out when tried to swing like Tarzan\rfrom the high platform. Pamela was brave enough to give a try.\nAfter that me and Aarush went to the river for a quick dip. But the Sun\rwas right on our head and we were forced to return to our tent. Aarush\rwas too happy to continue playing with his new friend (our guide). There\rwas no electricity as it went away around 10. After bath and lunch we\rtook a short nap before leaving for home. We started around 4 PM and\rreached home around 7.\nIt was a very short break but very refreshing as the whole resort was\rours and we had a lovely experience with the staff of Anandhadam .\nMore pictures of birds we spotted around\rAnandham.\nMaps\nView Larger\rMap","excerpt":"Prologue, On 2ndof Feb received an open invitation from our\rMD to be a part of her team to walk 100KM within 48hours. The walk\rwas organized by OXFAM to raise funds and awareness of their work among\rpoor section of society. I immediately hit reply as my earlier\rdiscussion with another friend on the same walk did not materialized.\nIn the late afternoon I received confirmation that I am in and need to\rwalk on 10 \u0026amp; 11thFeb.","ref":"https://santm.com/blog/2012-04-03-anandhadam/","title":"Anandhadam"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/palk-strait/","title":"Palk Strait"},{"body":"After complete rest and rainy night we woke up to find a perfect morning\rin Madurai. Breakfast at the hotel was quite elaborate and we did a good\rone before starting for Rameshwaram. The hotel guys were kind enough\rto give us elaborate maps which really helped us to exit Madurai without\rasking for any direction. One thing we noticed in Tamil-Nadu the\rdirection boards are mostly in Tamil and less of English compared to\rKarnataka. The distance between Madurai and Rameshwaram is around 170\rKM. The road is mostly undivided 2 lane Indian highway. There are few\rpatch of the road which has pot holes otherwise the road is in good\rcondition. The general scenery was very green and the key factor\rVaigai river flows along the highway NH49.While going we did not\rstopped and directly reached Ramanathaswamy Temple. We crossed the\runique Pamban Bridge and left photo shot for our return. We had to pay\raround 30 INR as entry fee for Rameshraam.\n\nAs soon as we entered the temple we were approached by a guide who was\rfluent with Hindi and agreed for a mutual price. He guided through many\rkunds ( holy water – hole) where we had to wash our head. There is a\rcatch 22 situation you might get drenched in the water but when you\renter the temple to pray you must be in dry cloth. We literally dashed\rthrough the huge complex and this guide used all kind of tricks like\rpushing, back door entry to ensure we get the a good glimpse of the\rdieties with minimal wait. It was good to have him otherwise it would\rhave taken us long time to go around. The walkway is always moist while\rhallways are dark so be careful with your steps. I was bitten by some\rinsect badly on one of my foot.\nAfter temple visit we went to Dhanushkodi to see the beach; drive\rwas worth. From there you can see Sri-Lanka’s shore line. The beach was\rnot very clean and more over it was hot noon so returned back\rquickly.One of the attraction of Rameshwaram is Abdul Kalam’s house.\rBut it was very sad to say the approach road was full of knee-deep water\rand it felt like driving over sewage water to reach the great man’s\rbirth place. Definitely Rameshraam city council needs to spend some\rmoney to make this ex-house of the great Indian a true attraction.At\r3.30 pm after lunch when we started back towards Madurai. We stopped at\rPamban Bridge for some photo shoot. This is the first sea bridge in\rIndia connecting Rameshwaram and mainland India built by British in\r1914. Mid way we encountered a big torrential Northeast Monsoon. It was\ralmost 6:30 in the evening when we reached the outskirts of Madurai. We\rhad two options either to stay back in Madurai for the night or drive\rdown to Kanayakumari.\nAfter calling friends and gaining confidence on the road condition we\ropted for the second one. The NH-7 between Madurai and Kanayakumari was\rvery new which meant even though it is a 4 lane divided highway the toll\rcollection has not started yet. That had one major draw back as you need\rto be extra vigilant as road marks were also not proper.\nWe stopped for refueling (near Tiruneveli exit) and stretched our legs.\rAt the end the main highway goes towards Kerala and we needed to take an\rturn which we missed and had to make an U-turn after missing it for the\rfirst time. It was 11 in the night when we reached Kanyakumari . We\rsettled for hotel Samudra, the room was very basic but we were OK\rand did not had any energy left to find a better place. The best part of\rthis hotel is it was just adjacent to sea where you can hear the sound\rof waves.\n Indeed it was a long driving day with almost 600 KM from the morning.\n External Links\n Pamban\rBridge  Hotel\rSamudra ","excerpt":"After complete rest and rainy night we woke up to find a perfect morning\rin Madurai.

So we said why not a second car \u0026hellip;\nLooked around in the classifieds but nothing clicked. There were just\rthree cars in our list\n  Nano - Pros Price Cons - no power steering and many more as\rlisted by others.  Alto - Pros A complete car compared to Nano Cons Price\rdifference almost 1.5 L to 1.8L different between different trims.  Reva - Pros Alternative fuel Cons - Long running cost with\rBattery replacement, niche car in itself, Price is quite high 4.25L\rwith AC model. After doing test drive on Nano \u0026amp; Alto Pamela said she is OK for Alto but\rfor not for Nano (power steering).\n\nWe dropped Reva along the path and did not did a test drive.\nBut after 10 days of deliberation I had a test drove Nano. Definitely it\ris different compared all the cars I drove till date. Found I can manage\rit in city traffic for few days in a week. Plan to drive this when I\rknow for sure I will be late; other sunny days can always take BIAS and\rhave a worry free commute.\nNow why CX ??? -having AC in car was a must so the basic model was\rdropped. Found LX for another 30K is too much. As we would not be\rdriving this car in extreme condition do not need fog lights and other\rfeatures. With current 20K discount on road price for CX is just 2 lakhs\rwhich sounds right for me. Dealer promised to put sun film, mud guard\rand floor mats as complimentary.

While we were\rthinking where to go and on browsing Mahindra Homestay found there is\r50% discount offer (with complementary breakfast) in one homestay in\rMunnar. We just booked it without any second thought.\nWe started on Thursday evening around 5 PM from Bangalore and reached\rSalem at 21:30 PM with one stop at old faithful A2B in Krishnagiri. It\rwas raining almost from 7.00pm and had to drive carefully. We had no\rclue on where to stay at Salem and on asking at Salem Toll Plaza we were\rdirected for GRT Grand. It is on leftside\ron highway; we asked for little bit of discount on their printed price\rwhich they agreed. GRT is a premier hotel chain within Tamil Nadu with\rmodern room and fully furnished.\n\nOn Friday after a good night sleep and grand breakfast we started around\r10:30. Just before leaving hotel suddenly met with one of my college\rjunior who was going to Thekkady(Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary). Well,\rafter short talk we continued on NH-47, and reached Chinnar Forest via\rTiruppur (famous for hosiery products) and Udumalaipettai. There were\raround 4 check points where you need to get out of the car and write\ryour name with Forest officials. Did not carried any money with me on\rpurpose and did not paid a single penny of bribe, this officials expect\ranyone with a KA number plate car as IT professional with spare cash\rfor them.

And slowly it became\rcloudy after which we went to Tea Factory Museum next to Munnar town.\rPost lunch we headed to Pallivasal for a\rKathakali show. The Kathakali show was\rspectacular .\nMonday 15th August -\u0026gt; Started around 7 from HomeStay, reached\rSalem (GRT Grand) around 1:30 PM for lunch.

Well I am quite positive on\rthis sudden turn of event that this happened for good. Pamela suddenly\rjackpot a teaching Job with one of the premier institute of Bangalore.\rAnd they asked her to join immediately. The first week was in training\rin Kormangala was OK OK as Aarush had his summer camp in his old\rschool. They also have a day care so he got the adjusted to the same\rquite easily for the first week.Well end of the above paragraph does not\rqualify for a thought or blog post and does not happen in real life ?\rThe ground reality was very different one but fun filled. The first week\rPamela had to reach to her training by 8:30 and she is not yet\rcomfortable in driving in Bangalore traffic. So opted for one temporary\rdriver from an agency while we searched for a permanent one. That\rresulted in losing the luxury of car for me. Honestly that was boon and\rI am with BMTC Bus. The fun and difficult part was becoming a morning\rDAD for Aarush. Now I have to prepare him for school with shower and\rbreakfast and etc. But to my delight Aarush has been very positive as he\rrealised this new person is bit different from his beloved mother.We\rbooked a 2 week vacation in end of May to visit my parental home. My\ryounger brother will be coming from California and we will celebrate\r‘rice ceremony’ for their son (Sheryaan). Now as Pamela can not go we\rcancelled our ticket at first thinking to cancel the trip. Now this is\rreally a big event which we did not want to miss but it means Aarush\rhave to come with me as he can not be left alone in Bangalore. With that\rI need to make fresh booking of Air ticket with some serious dent on my\rcredit card ? I had to buy the same ticket 3-4 times costlier for myself\rand Aarush.I had to make Aarush aware of this upcoming BIG trip every\rday morning while preparing his for school. But the D-Day he was\rthinking it was more of me going on a trip then himself as the bag was\rnot that big. But when we got down at Airport he was OK and we quickly\rmoved through checking and security and boarded the flight. The flight\rwas a late one starting at 21:00 from Bangalore and reaching Calcutta\rclose to midnight. In the flight Aarush said he wanted to have some food\rwhich was a very positive thing as after having it he fall asleep. On\rreaching Calcutta we took a TAXI and reached a our hotel. A lot of\rstrange eyes in Calcutta even one asked where is his mother ?? Well as\rit was very late Aarush slept easily.\nNext morning we had our flight to Siliguri at noon the postponement was\rinformed to me in advance. So we left hotel late and had a leisurely\rbrunch for Aarush and myself. At the airport Aarush opted for Idli (on\rof his favorite ) while I slipped a cup of coffee. He was very trilled\rwith the ATR and it wings compared to yesterday’s jet. And more over it\rwas a day flight where he could see lots of things. Reaching Siliguri\rand at home he was OK. He was a hero to many eyes. On the day of return\rhe was very excited to go back to Bangalore and joining Pamela whom he\rmissed for 4 days.\nThe return flight was smooth – Aarush slept on the flight between\rCalcutta Bangalore and some paste on reaching Bangalore Airport.\nOn 8th June he started his school with DPS. The first three days I need\rto go with him and on 13th on-wards he started going by the School Bus.\rThe new routine is very demanding as Aarush have to get ready in 50 min\rto reach Bus-Stop within Godrej Campus by 07:30 AM. Every morning he\rsuggests it is a holiday at school but once in Bus he is OK. It is\ralready 2 weeks he is going by Bus and coming back to Day-care where he\rwill have his lunch and nap and then Pamela picks him up while returning\rfrom School.

For God knows what reason here all homestay are highly\rpriced based on per person per night. The Mountain section from\rChikmaglur to Attigundi (village) was excellent and fun to drive on the\rtwist and turn. The last part was a dirt road where we took diversion\rfor our homestay a downhill road. Almost reaching there we saw three\rgates to enter three different coffee estates. Bit confused initially\rbut then figured out by guessing. Best part here you don’t get any\rsignal on your mobile other than BSNL (state owned provider).\nOn reaching there we were given welcome drink and then showed our room\rby friendly staffs. It was not yet dusk and we freshened and sat in\rtheir dinning deck area to watch sunset. Mean while Aarush became friend\rwith their in-house puppy. Although we were bit scared but he was fine\rwith him. Valley in front of dining deck gave great view of sunset and\rsunrise.\nThere was another couple other than us who came to celebrate their\rbirthday. They were friendly we enjoyed their company that night. Aarush\rdozed off early evening unusual then other days as he had lots of\ractivity for one afternoon. Next morning we woke up bit late and missed\rthe sun rise but enjoyed morning serenity. Only thing we encountered\rhere was butterflies and flock of birds chattering merrily. Around 10 we\rall got ready for their estate trip to go down in their 4X4 jeep.\nThe first part of the estate trip was an introduction to different\rtype’s coffee and their processing. We saw how it is dried under sun and\rtested the sweet coffee berries. We went to a roaring water fall within\rthe Estate, Aarush and Santanu had nice time under fall. There after we\rwaited for a while for our lunch. In meanwhile we came to know that all\restate managers who kept us in good company with small talks and jokes.\rWith chitchat we all became so friendly that hardly we felt that few\rmin. Before we were all strangers and how time went by…didn’t have any\rtrack of time. They even arranged a rifle shooting for other guest to\rcelebrate his B’day.\n\nLate evening we were dropped to our rooms back then after relaxing we\rwent for evening walk. We walked through other estate where we could\rhear the music of the cascades that dot this scenic landscape. And then\rfinally found small stream of water gushing through their estates.Next\rmorning around 10 we started for our return journey to Bangalore\rleisurely. On way back we paid 200 INR extra to traffic police for\rtaking one way route at Chikmaglur town.\n This resort is more of a tone down motel rather than homestay as it is\rmanaged by people rather than owner directly. The food was average and\rcooked by a North Indian chef and nothing extra ordinary it taste just\rlike any other common restaurant. That way a touch of local cuisine or\ra real host was missing. Standard of room were very basic. Only thing\rthat was positive for us was since all estate owners were there (it\rwas coffee picking season) we had nice time. And jeep trip and lunch\rat the bottom of their estate was free for us as we asked for it.\n View Larger\rMap","excerpt":"After finishing\rBelur-Halebid\rby 3.00PM we moved towards Chikmaglur as we wanted to reach our\rApna-Sapna homestay\rbefore dusk.

The network is\rvast and somewhat efficient. But it is no way near to world class even\rthough it was one of the best luxury trains in its flight. For most\rIndian travelling in train means a sleeper class more and more prefer AC\rone now days. With ticket price of Airlines going up more and more\rpeople are going back to train as it is still easy on pocket. The only\rdrawback is it is extremely slow in modern context. A 1000 KM journey\rtakes 24 hours to complete, where as TGV cross whole France in couple of\rhours.\nComing back to the personal part I had to travel to Mumbai on a personal\rtrip and opted for train over the last weekend. I started from Bangalore\ron Thursday at 20:30 and reached Mumbai around 20:00. The journey was\rquite peaceful not that crowded general sleeper class. And had catch-up\rof lots of sleep during that journey. Reaching CSTM (former VT) bought a\r1stclass ticket for the local and reached Kharghar.\nSaturday woke up early, cleaned up the old belongings from my brother\rapartment and ensured our one is also in proper condition. Settled with\rold tenant and signed a new lease with the new one. By midday it was all\rdone and I was quite relaxed that all these long pending to-do list\rultimately got shortened.\nIn the evening hired a cab to reach Dadar for the return train.\rUnfortunately I did not bought my ticket using TATKAL(immediate) and was\ron wait list which was in RAC(Reservation against Cancellation) state.\rNow with RAC you can bored the train but have to share a seat with\rsomeone else.\nThe train was packed and there was no way to move up the chart to get a\rberth of my own. At Pune a family boarded who had 7 or 8 confirmed\rseats. They wanted all their seat nearby and agreed to give up 2 seat in\rreturn of one. This felt like a gift from God to me and my co-passenger.\rThis kind of luck never happened to me before to be honest. So had a\rgood sleep during the night. Afternoon I was feeling sleepy so went to\rsleep again but the rain started to pack-up with normal pessengers. This\ris quite common in Sleeper class where people without reservation( at\rday time) gets in as the general coaches are so much packed that flies\rcan not squeeze in. Well it almost lasted till Bangalore and train\rsomehow got delayed by an hour.\nSo as whole it was a OK journey comparing to my college days. Where it\rused to take me almost 3 to 4 days to reach home. But definitely cannot\rdo this journey with Aarush at this age, he needs to wait for few more\ryears.\nWell this journey is not about any fancy experience but I am sure every\rcommon Indian has stories to share on their train journeys. Here is the\rexpense I did …\nTrain ( Bangalore to Mumbai ) – INR 468\nTrain ( within Mumbai) INR 115\nCab (Mumbai) – 500 INR\nCab(Bnagalore) – 370 INR\nLooks like I spent more on local travel within the city than the train\rticket … a more thought on the same……..\n","excerpt":"Indian railway ferries millions of passenger each day.

From then on it was always in discussion to visit Belur-Halebid\rknown for its hoysala architecture. This time we covered both\rBelur-Halebid along with Chigmanglur on 3 day trip. We started at\r7.10AM from our parking lot and reached Halebid by 12 with two breaks -\rbreakfast at Hotel Mayura and at Hassan for ATM.\nCompared to 2009 road was far far better and journey was smooth. Still\rthere are many parts where road work is going on and it is not yet\rdivided 4 lane highway and around Kunigal there are some bad pot holes.\rOn reaching Halebid we hired a guide for 200 INR which was in-fact must\rto know the details and history. The whole architecture is made of soap\rstone. He carried small mirror to reflect the sunlight in order to\rexplain intricate details of temple.\nHalebid’s patron God is Shiva and the temple was built by the\rminister in honour of the King and the Queen. This is an incomplete\rconstruction where 3 generations of workers have worked but in many\rplaces you will notice ‘works in progress. It has suffered most damages\ramongst the three Somnathpura, Halebid and Belur. Today Helebedu in\rKanada literally means ‘an old town’ to reflect its neglected past. It is unique with its two gigantic figures of Nandi (sacred bull) - One\rof them houses Vishnuvardhana Hoysaleshwara (King) and the other\rShanthaleshwara (Queen). The bulls are decorated in distinct male and\rfemale ornaments to reflect whom they belong. The temple walls are\rcovered with figures of men in battles, dancing women, Hindu deities,\rbirds and animals. A stone platform is there at the centre of the hall\rwhere queen used to dance for the Lord Chennakeshava. Temple stands in\rthe middle of a peaceful park by the side of a lake.\nOur guide enlightened us with an interesting tale that many sculptures\rwere stolen and taken away by the British when they left India and those\ridols are now gracing homes in England and elsewhere. It takes at least\rtwo hours to take a round of the temple exteriors. There is so much to\rsee in just one temple that we completely lost track of time here.\nJain basadi is very near to Hoysaleswara temple which are equally rich\rin sculptural detail they are famous for its pillars, which are highly\rpolished almost resembling mirrors. First is Parshwanatha basadi- this\rcomplex consists of three temples. Famous is the Parswanathaswamy\rTemple, which has a 14 ft high figure made of black stone. A\rseven-headed serpent has been imprinted on the head of this figure.\rAdinathaswamy (central mandir) and Shanthinathaswamy are the other two\rtemples here.\nAt road end there is Kedareshwara temple but there was no one except us\rvisiting the temple. Though it shares same architectural elements with\rits neighbour it is a miniature of the former.\nFrom here we went to Belur at just 16 km apart it is a living town.\rEntrance to both the Hoysaleshwara temple and the Chennakeshava temple\ris free. The Chennakeshava Temple in Belur is dedicated to the Hindu god\rVishnu and active worship still goes on in this temple while Halebid\rtemple, though open to the public, is no longer in use for devotional\rpurposes. Like the Hoysaleshwara Temple, the Chennakeshavatemple is\rstar-shaped and stands on a platform. Elephants, episodes from the\repics, sensuous dancers nothing was left without being carved. Forty-six\rpillars support the extensive hall, each of a different design. The\rNarasimha pillar is worth watching.\nThe sculpted inner \u0026amp; outer walls of the temple tell a tale of dedication\rand sheer hard work by the craftsmen. Each figure is carved to\rperfection and straining to come to life any moment. The celestial\rbeauties depict the lifestyles of that time showing dancers, shringar,\rfeeding the pets etc. The walls of the star-shaped temple are literally\rcovered with sculptures in stone that depict the various events in the\repics of Ramayana and Mahabharata. The star design starts from the\rplatform and goes all the way up the walls and up to the top of the\rshikhara.\nWe skipped lunch in order to cover this area and can reach Chikmaglur\rbefore dusk. A day is enough to explore both sites if you think you are\rnot too bored with sculptures. In Belur we didn’t hired guide which we\rregret later.\n P.S. As mentioned by Mr.Bhat the worship continues in Halebid temple.\n More Photos from\rHalebid More Photos from\rBelur ","excerpt":"It has been a long time that we ventured on NH-48; last time we visited\rShravanabelagola\rin 2009.

Many shops\rwere closed on account of after Diwali mood but still we managed to hop\rfrom one shop to another - Rajasthali, blue pottery shop etc. Then we\rtried the famous Ram Chandra Kulfi (Indian Ice Cream) in Tripolia\rBazaar on way back to hotel for a siesta and left for Sanganer \u0026amp; Chokhi-\rDhani around 5ish.\nWe took Jaipur-Tonk Highway and did more shopping at Sanganer famous\rfor its block printing, screen printers, blue pottery and hand made\rpapers.

Rajasthan roads are amazing; and they are\rvery well connected interms of bus, train, private cars, even one can\rhire cars to drive around between different places with in state. This\rmakes travelling in Rajasthan quite safe and less tiring. With good road\rconditions you can also explore the interiors of Rajasthan.\nThis fact remains same even today when I visited with my family on oct.\r2010. The time from Oct to December is considered ideal to visit\rRajasthan, though its high tourist season. One major drawback is they\rwill make feel Indian tourists discriminated infront of westners as they\rget Tips in foreign currency.\nRajasthan is full of great eating out options from the regular highway\rdhabas to the most luxurious hotels in India. They have very rich\rculture interms of dress colour, turbans- they have more than 1000 types\rand styles of doing the turban, the variations depending on the region,\rcasteand creed in the society. An array of instruments such\ras sarangi, ektara, dhol, chang etc are used to create melodious\rtunes as well as variations in folk dances. Camel safari is “must do”\rdepends if across Thar then its a great way to explore the vastness of\rthe desert. Once you like the culture you feel like pluging deeper and\rgetting mesmerised.\nBeing one of the tourist hub it is highly commercialized in almost\revery aspect of its existence. There are many remote areas mostly\rnomadic villages, where entertaining the tourists is the only form of\rlivelihood that can be thought of. Also, all tourist attractions charge\rfor photography and videography which is worth but surprising thing is\rdifference in prices for foreigner and indian tourist.\nAnother thing which I like about this place is they know business very\rwell. If you go for shopping and think that certain thing may have to\rpay extra at airport then ofcourse you can opt for their courier service\rwhich they will do for free. But be aware, certain times complain are\rthere that they send defective piece or change the fabric which you have\ropted for after it\u0026rsquo;s INDIA where everything can happen.\nSantanu is so impressed that he wants to travel again to Rajasthan but\rwith different route probably - Bikaner, Mt.Abu ,Udaipur,\rChittorgarh,Kota,Bundi, Ranthambore, Agra back to Jaipur. One thing I\rwould like to add here is with no. of days we have spent there we could\rhave easily covered Bikaner.\n","excerpt":"The first thing that struck me about Rajasthan was its roads when I last\rwent in 2000 with my parents.

This time our\rcab driver from hotel (Madhuban) was waiting and on reaching hotel\rrelaxed for while. Before leaving for Jodhpur, we have fixed\rwith Mr. Singh (our reliable cab driver) for this trip to\rAjmer-Pushkar. As usual, he was there on time; left hotel room\raround 8.00am. Had our breakfast on way at small neat and clean dhaba.\rRoad being 6 lane; had very comfort drive and was hardly crowded.\nWe went first to Kishangarh fort, with Phool Mahal Palace, a\rheritage hotel along side and Gundalao Lake on the front. This\rheritage hotel was previously the residence of the Maharajas of\rKishangarh. Major part of lake bed is now converted into verdant fields.\rArea is quite famous for miniature paintings. But being holiday we could\rnot visit any art gallery. Took few snaps and headed towards our next\rdestination.\nSoniji Ki Nasiyan at Ajmer is a DigambarJain temple. The main\rchamber, known as the Swarna Nagari (City of Gold), has several\rgold-plated wooden figures, depicting characters in the Jain tradition.\rThe main prayer hall is a separate complex.\nFrom there went to Dargah Sharif of Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti. Being\ra Diwali day and Friday it was overly crowded. We had to leave camera\rand shoes outside with a flower stall and head covering was mandatory.\rAfter paying our obeisance we asked for the way to Adhai Din Ka\rJhopda, a Vaishnav Hindu temple constructed in 1153 and later\rconverted into a mosque by Qutubudin Aybak in 1193. We went there by\rwalk through a small lanes which are full of small eateries and sweet\rshops. If you are hygiene freak you might want to skip this part of\rAjmer.\nMr. Singh took us to Anasagar Lake, man-made lake to relax and to\rtake a break. It was really refreshing and helped us in gaining our\rbreath break after all those pushing and Ochlophobia in-around Dargah.\nAjmer and Pushkar are two side of common mountain range and distance\rbetween them is only 15 KM. We first went to Brahma **(**the\rcreator of the universe) temple at Pushkar. The best irony of\rHindu mythology is Lord brahma is only worshiped in Pushkar in the whole\runiverse as he was cursed by his 1stwife. Two temples of his\rtwo wives are at the top of two separate mountain tops and in between is\rhis temple next to Pushkar lake.Unlike dargah, there was hardly any\rcrowd here.\nFinally, went to Pushkar lake where all the house next to lake are\rpainted in blue to symbolize the Brahmin owner. Just opposite to lake\rthere is one resto where we had scrumptious Pasta (which was awesome) as\rlunch. On way back went to see Chota Pushkar nearby and by early\revening we were at Jaipur city to celebrate Diwali.

We didn\u0026rsquo;t had that service from hotel as it\rwas extra 100INR so on reaching station we found, 10 people surrounded\rus even they don’t allow couples to talk among themselves. Finally\rhired one for 40 INR to go to Deoki Niwas hotel. When we reached, we\rliterally had to wake them up. It’s newly started so spic n span with\rgood service and breakfast.\nAfter rest around 10.00am we went to Satyajit Ray\u0026rsquo;s “sonar kella” -\rJaisalmer fort where we hired a guide who took us around. This\rpalace is made of yellowish sandstone, crowned by several ornate Jain\rtemples. Many of the houses and temples are finely sculptured. It is\ronly living fort and about a quarter of city\u0026rsquo;s population still live\rinside the fort. The main attractions inside the fort are: Raj Mahal\r(Royal palace), Jain temples and the Laxminath temple and four\rmassive gates. It is filled with many artistic structures and monuments\rof historical importance.\nOther then this there are havelis like: Patwon-ki-Haveli is ornate\rfive-storey complex took fifty years to complete. This is the largest,\rmagnificent and the most elaborate of Jaisalmer havelis. Among others\rare Nathmalji-ki-Haveli, Salam Singh-ki-Haveli, Haveli Shreenath. We\rcovered this havelis by walk as they are very close by. Some of the\rdoors and ceilings are wonderful examples of old carved wood from many\rhundreds years ago. Some of the doors have brass or iron fittings.\rCertain facade is a riot of ornamentation: flowers, birds, elephants,\rsoldiers, a bicycle and even a steam engine. These havelis have\rcountless rooms, with decorated windows, archways, doors and balconies\rand some have still lived in by the families that built them.\nWe had our late lunch near entrance to fort at Little Italy(nothing\rgreat). Then in afternoon 4PM we booked for desert safari they took\rus to Lodhurva. Lodhurva is famous for its Jain temples which are build\rwith same yellow stones. There is a Kalpavriksha or the celestial\rtree build with metals which replaced the original tree died. Since we\rdidn’t book for any camel safari beforehand (I mean it was on spot)\rso kind of they cheated us by stopping quite before the actual Sam\rsand dune and they wanted us to go by camel. 2-3 KMs before reaching\ractual point of san dune we saw sun set and on reaching spot it was\ralready dusk I was very depressed being cheated in this way as we went\rto see sunset only but Santanu-Aarush had nice time with first\rexperience on camel ride.\nWith heavy heart we returned to Jaisalmer fort and had dinner at 8th\rJuly run by an Indian who resides in Australia. The highly\rpersonalized service of Mrs. Rama Bhatia ensuring that you get\rabsolutely home cooked food hygienically prepared. Jags has an in-depth\rknowledge of shayri and old Hindi film music. Although it is slightly\rexpensive but I guess one needs to pay a little extra for clean and\rtasty food.\nNext morning Santanu went alone to see Gadisar Lake as Aarush was\rsleeping. Then after breakfast leisurely we checked out around 10.30am\rand went again to fort after taking one round of fort; went to 8th July\rrestaurant where Mrs. Rama Bhatia was already in work we took the best\rlocation with wonderful views of the palace under shade (its Veg resto\rand offers fresh alphanzo mango juice- tall glass). The restaurant is\rnear Dussera pol gate and opposite the Palace. We ended up having lunch\rand packed food for dinner and returned to hotel to pick our luggage as\rhe had our tain back to Jaipur at 4.00pm.It was our 2 day one night\rtrip.\n More\rPictures TIP: Only one night is enough for Jaisalmer or or at the most 2\rnight stay if one likes to stay in sand dunes. Sam sand-unes is\rhighly commercialised. In last 10 years, it has changed a lot. Some\rsuggested Khuri a village 45 km south west of Jaisalmer as better\rlocation for Sand dunes. Train (#4060) does not have a pantry car\rso please pick your dinner before leaving Jaisalmer.\n ","excerpt":"We reached Jaisalmer early morning around 4.00am.Going from station\rto hotel is another headache if you don’t have pick-up service\rparticularly at wee hours.

But luck is\ralways not in favour we got one nasty cab driver unlike Jaipur. Although\rhired cab through hotel and asked to take us to Osyian but he insisted\ron going to majestic sandstone palace of Umaid Bhawan. Before going\rthere he took us to shops for early morning shopping but we\rdidn’t.(they get commission when they take clients to their choice of\rplace). Anyways, on reaching there we found that it was not yet open so\rwe had to wait till it get opened. One part of this palace is converted\rto 5-star hotel, in second part king stays and third part is\rmuseum which is open to public.\nFrom here we asked him to take us to Osyian famous for cluster of\rruined brahmanical and jain temples dating from the 8th to 11th\rcenturies. He took us to Sachiya mata temple but insisted to take one\rguide of his choice which we didn’t like but we had to. They are\rbeautifully designed in terms of architecture. For entering the Sachiya\rMata temple complex, there are series of magnificently sculpted\rarches.Outside walls of temple are beautifully sculpted with different\rdieties. Along with these there are many small temples around like jain\rtemple, surya temple, vishnu temple, shiv mandir, pippala devi temple\rand harihara temple. The temples are raised on huge plinths. Almost\revery space in the temples is sculpted to a great extent. The temple\rceilings were conceived by quite an imaginative mind and are decorated\rwith lace like motifs.\nOsyian holds a great significance for the Jain community.From top to\rbottom of temple they highly and beautifully carved-worth visiting this\rplace. It takes almost 2 hrs to cover these area.\nIt was almost noon when we left for mandore garden which is said to\rbe maiden place of Queen Mandodri, wife of King RAVAN of Shri Lanka.It\ris highly neglected site but fine piece of architecture. It houses\rcenotaphs and memorials of many rulers which is worth seeing. The garden\ralso has a baoli and a hall of heroes that consists of 15 carved\rfigures. These figures carved out of single red sandstone.As it was too\rhot we had icecream here.\nThen went towards Meherangarh fort but again our cabdriver insisted\rus to do shopping of his choice and took us to 2-3 places then lastly\rseeing our irritated face he went straight to fort. It is one of the\rlargest fort with massive ramparts built around the edges. We hired a\rguide here who took us around showing intricate carvings of moti\rmahal, sheesh mahal, phool mahal, zenana deodi, chamunda mataji temple,\rmuseum having exquisite collection of palanquins, elephant howdahs,\rarmoury, paintings,music instrument,turbans etc. Entry to fort is\rthrough many gates like: jai pol, fateh pol, dedh kamgra pol, loha\rpol. Top of fort gives a breath taking view of blue city of\rbrahmapur. Basically, those who are brahmins they paint outside\rwall of their house in blue color. One can see winding roads to and from\rcity. We had late lunch within fort campus as we did not wanted to take\rour cab-driver to place of his choice. It was almost 5.00pm\nThen we asked him to take to Jaswant thada to which he said it is\rclosed as already 5.00 but we also now insisted on going there.Truly,\rabout to close but seeing us coming running they allowed us to which we\rare highly obliged. It is again architectural landmark made of white\rmarble. These marbles are extremely thin, polished and intricately\rcarved so that they emit a warm glow when the sun\u0026rsquo;s rays dance across\rtheir surface.\nFrom here we straight came to hotel as we had already checked out in\rmorning; we wanted to take shower to freshen ourself so on request they\rgave us one room for 1hr.We had dinner innearby mall at Mc.Donald.Today\rwe had late night train to Jaisalmer.\n","excerpt":"We started early morning after breakfast around 8 .00am.

Unlike\rhis earlier trip he just had a casual look at the route map to\rShravanabelagola, it is a religious spot, a Jain pilgrimage centre.\rThe place is famous for 58ft. high monolithic stone statue of the Lord\rGommateshwara.\nYeshvantapur -\u0026gt; Neelamangala -\u0026gt; Kunigal -\u0026gt; Shravanabelagola\nMorning 6.30AM we started; roads were full of potholes from Yeshvantapur\rwith flyover construction still going on till Neelamangala where we lost\rroute after taking 2 U- turns ended up asking locals then got into right\rroad(NH-48) but that was again full of pot holes.We had breakfast at\rHotel Mayura on the way, it was almost 11; Aaursh enjoyed their play\rarea.\nThen we headed straight towards our destination and reached\rShravanabelagola without much problem as roads were marked properly. The\rtwo stony hills called Chandragiri and Indragiri on either side\rwith lake in between makes famous Jain pilgrimage center. Just within\rgate you will find a paid toilet and shoe stand where you have to leave\ryour shoes and climb up this hill by foot. Flight of about 660 steps\rto the top, cutout in the rock, people of all ages climb these steps.\rFor elderly or handicapped people there is a palanquin transport\rservice available to avoid the strenuous hike. These rough rock cut\rsteps are steep at places; we had socks on our feet as the rock gets\rhotter as with days. We began the climb and stopped in-between to get\rour breath back and took some pictures. It took around 30 - 40 minutes\rto reach the top. On the way up, we found breathtaking views of the\rChandragiri temple and the lake in-between.The huge statue of Bahubali\rand the view around is stunning. It is carved beautifully from a single\rblock of rock with accurate sense of proportion and expression. All the\r42 Tirthankaras carved figures are there in the corridor around the\rquadrangle. The Downhill was more enjoyable, as you had to court gravity\rand slope.It is equally steep so better be careful !!!\nTook about 30 mins to reach the base of Vindhyagiri.There are numerous\rhomely Marwari / Jain food available in the nearby lane on left side\rwhile you enter from the gate I strongly suggest you plan your lunch\reither here in one of these since its a different experience OR best\ris to have free lunch at Official bhojanalay. Small by-lane next to\rgate on inner side along the office goes straight to Dharamshala with a\rbig gate where after giving donation you can have lunch which is served\rto you in rows umpteen times.\nAfter having lunch here, we went to the place where Chandragupta\rbreathed his last named Chandragiri (Chikkabetta) hill. It is a\rsmall hill is located just opposite to the Vindhyagiri hill. It has\rmemorials to numerous monks and shravakas who have meditated there.\rSteps have been cut out in this hill and the ascent is not different\rfrom Vindhyagiri. After spending there till 4.00pm we started our\rjourney back home via Mandya. Aarush went to sleep as soon as car\rstarted to roll. The road via Mandya was better as there was not much\rtraffic and not those potholes even. Aarush woke up next day around 9AM\ra record which we still recollect.\nTIP: Carry pair of socks to avoid buying there so that if needed\rone can use it as with sun\u0026rsquo;s brightness rocks tend to become hot making\rit almost impossible to climb bare feet.\n","excerpt":"Me and Aarush just returned a day before Santanu’s birthday from Durg\rand he wanted an excuse from strenuous week at IIM-B and we ended up\rplanning to visit Shravanabelagola right after Diwali day.

The train was late as it arrived from\rDelhi. On the train meet Subhojit who was also in Rajasthan for one\rlong week break just like us from Bangalore. Their itinerary was bit\rdifferent compared to us and they were going to Jaiselmer. On the wee\rhours of 1st November reached the platform of Jodhpur and thankgod for\rensuring that hotel provided a cab for pickup. Otherwise bargaining and\rnegotiating with cab and auto drivers would be very difficult when you\rare half sleepy in a new town.\nReached our hotel Kuchamann haveli and slept as much we can. Some\rhow pulled ourselves out of the bed at 7.30am had breakfast. And at\r8.20am started for bishnoi village day trip. Aarush was still\rsleeping when we reached the Jeep.\nOur driver cum guide gave a brief description about Bishnoi community\r(29 bish: twenty, noi: nine) and was dressed in traditional attire and\rpicked us in a old Willy Jeep. Although these people are Hindu, they\rbury their dead to give the body back to the nature and save woods for\rcremation. They are considered to be very eco friendly in order to\rprotect trees even Khejarli Massacre (where 363 bishnoi people\rsacrificed to protect the trees) took place. Idea behind this tour is\rthat it helps you escape from the modernity and rush of the city and\rtakes you to “off beaten path” - small villages where the locals\rlive.\nOn the way, from Jodhpur to Guda village we spotted some wild life\r(spotted deer, blue bulls and antelopes) which seems bishnoi people\rbeing close to nature they don\u0026rsquo;t kill them. Famous case of Salman\rKhan shooting a dear happened around here. Our guide was driving in\rbit speed and failed to maneuver which caused our Jeep to topple side\rwise. Luckily nothing happened to any one and around 6-7 people came by\rto lift the jeep from the trench. Aarush was bit shocked and still\rremembers this incident clearly.\nOur reception was warm and friendly starting with a visit to traditional\ropium ceremony. Although, Opium is illegal in India but the locals\rhave special rights preserved for them to continue with their\rtraditional practices. Very strange thing here is penniless women flaunt\rheavy silver jewelry. One more thing to notice was women being the\rsymbol of creation they wear vibrant colors such as red and orange while\rmen wear white as a symbol of cleanliness and austerity.\nThen we saw many shepherds on the way to singhasni (Muslim religion\rPotter\u0026rsquo;s village). We were instructed on how to spin the wheel, form\rclay and set the pots out to dry. The village looks like a battlefield\rwith its drying pots resembling piles of cannonballs. Santanu did try\rhis hand but it seems it’s not that easy as it looks to be. When they\rtake you to such trip they expect you to buy their products.\nTo round out our trip we stopped at Salawas (Weavers village) where\rwe had our lunch. Before lunch we were shown how durries (mat) are\rweaved; when he starts to speak he knows business, literally. Then\rtraditional lunch was offered to us. After meal, although mat(durry) was\rcostly but we bought one and bid them bye. Its place where life still\rgoes on like the days of the past. The sun was quite hot and we came\rback around 3 PM back to hotel,\n\nAarush was sleepy but he did not sleep and as soon we boarded a auto he\rwas sleeping. We went to C-Road, sardarpura which is a lively part of\rJodhpur with many shops and eatery. The main purpose for going out was\rto dine at Gypsy. As we reached quite early Aarush was sleeping\rall along; we roamed around did little shopping before entering Gypsy a\rsuperb clean place to be for pure veg. rajasthani thali with one\rcondition food taken on plate can\u0026rsquo;t be thrown. Food is served umpteen\rnumber of times. And they keep asking for more serving which we really\renjoyed it. If you are a true connoisseur of food, then do not miss this\rplace it only cost 150 INR per plate.\n","excerpt":"31stmidnight boarded train to Jodhpur from Jaipur after a\rlong day we were very tired .

As Mr. Singh said jokingly lets\rstart the day in auspicious way – which mean Birla Temple was first\ron the list and we reached the parking lot at dot 9. The journey took us\rtrough the posh residential area of Jaipur with huge bungalows which\rhave similarities with the Lutyens’ Delhi but a rarity in modern India.\nBirla Temple of Jaipur like any other Birla Temple is made with pure\rwhite marble. There is Moti Dungri Fort in the back ground. Next to\rthe Birla Temple is most famous Ganesh Temple which we skipped. After\rthe quick tour of Birla Temple Mr. Singh took us for Breakfast. The\rchoice was very simple Jalebi and Samosa as coming from Bangalore we\rwere craving for it. The street we stopped was full of traditional\rsweet makers. The Samosa was just made in front of us and it was so\rfricking hot that we both burnt our tongue but both were too good.\nHawa Mahal was our next stop - the iconic building of Jaipur. We\rentered from the side and bought a combo ticket that allows entering 5\rGovernment maintained attractions. At ticket counter, we were told Audio\rGuide wasn’t available but which was not right as we saw the counter\ronce inside. We hired a guide for 150(posted price was 200 we were his\rfirst client).The guide was a gentle person who knew the history and the\rKodak-spots very well.\nFrom the back Hawa Mahal does not look that appealing, it has two big\rcourtyards. The building was made for the royal ladies so that they can\rview the world without being seen. There are around thousands (937) of\rwindows which over looks the Delhi-Jaipur highway. In those days, all\rthe big parades or activites used to happen on this road. And that\rallowed ladies to watch royal processions and festivities. In this five\rstorey building , top floor was for the maids and small children. The\router wall is not 90° rather inclined at 70° to give much better\rvisibility from the top. The small windows on the façade gives it a\rhoney comb look. From the top we could see city palace, Jantar Mantar\rclearly and the whole Aravalli (one of the oldest mountain range in the\rword) range which gives a natural protection to the city of Jaipur.\nFrom here went to Jantar Mantar; this time we were not that lucky as\rthere were no concession in terms of hiring a guide. The Founder king of\rJaipur was great in astronomy, he built five such Jantar Instruments \u0026amp;\rMantar(calculation) in India. Jaipur has the largest and best preserved\rof all. The largest sundial of the word has an accuracy of 2 seconds.\rThe other instruments are more complex and innovative. There always a\rsmall replica made before the big ones are constructed to ensure the\raccuracy is maintained. The Jantar Matar is quite well maintained but as\rusual there were few Indian who don’t follow rules and step into the\rconstructions for their photos.\nThe Sun was getting hotter in each passing minutes and so the\rnaughtiness of Aarush. Not sure it was due to Sun or just like that. But\rafter running around in Jantar Mantar we crossed road and entered City\rPalace. The city palace is divided into two parts one for the public\rand other where the current ruler still stays. The administration is\rprivate here. The ticket is quite expensive but the monument is very\rwell maintained. Chandra Mahal is part of the private part of current\rRoyal family a seven storey building which host the royal flag of\rJaipur. Almost after 90 minutes we made our exit from City palace and by\rthat time the heat was too much. We got some curd and fruits for Aarush\ron way towards Amber ford.\nOn the way we did stopped for few minutes at Maharani ki Chhatri and\rJal Mahal. Jal Mahal is on man made Man Sagar Lake.\nAmber Fort was the royal fort and Amber was capital before Man Singh\rmoved his capital and Royal Palace to the modern Jaipur. It has plenty\rof history and details for which a guide is must. Amber fort is build\rover centuries and the cost of the building is unknown but some say it\rmight cost 3 to 4 times the cost of Taj Mahal. The palace has the\rfamous Sheesh Mahal (palace of mirrors) which lights up with a single\rcandle. There are many passage which carries water and air to ensure\rthere is enough cooling for the hot summer month. The concept of\rsustainable architecture is at it best. I must admit the architects\rensured every drops of monsoon rain is saved and properly used so they\rcan survive a harsh drought if needed.\nIt took us more than an hour to walk around different parts of the\rpalace.We had a simple vegetarian lunch (very late one) before moving to\rJaigarh Fort. You can walk between Amber and Jaigarh fort if your legs\rand lungs permit; with car one needs to take a long detour. Aarush fall\rasleep as car started to roll. We paid extra so we can take our cab\rinside which was a great idea with sleeping Aaursh. Jaigarh Fort is\rsituated on a higher hill and that gives it a complete view of Amber\rfort. Jaigarh fort was a army station so in case of an emergency it can\rsave Royal Family located at Amber fort. It was closing time when we\rcame out of Jaigarh fort.\nLast on the list was Nahargarh Fort, it is on the edge of the hills\rand overlooks Jaipur city. We were lucky enough to catch Sunset but sky\rwas not very clear. By the time we finished Nahargarh Fort and headed\rback to Jaipur city it was dark.\nWe stopped at one shop for some shopping before returning to hotel where\rwe had a simple dinner after getting freshened up. That midnight,we had\rour train to Jodhpur. It was a very long day indeed.\n","excerpt":"We woke around 7ish and left by the same Cab with Mr. Singh (who took us\rto Shekhawati) around 8:30 from hotel.

It was a different protocol\reach time. Today I am lost in a mysterious maze of chasing thoughts;\rwant to pin them down and seal them in jars before they disappear\rleaving behind nothing but an empty spot. I came to Tata Sherwood when\rmy son was 5 months old and today he is almost 3 yrs old. In this time\rspan I met so many people. I had a great time here. With few I was\rreally close and with rest others I shared so much so that we have\ramicable relationship to talk on any topic without restricting myself to\rany specific age group or any particular culture.\nI remember when we moved to this apartment Santanu said while strolling\rin the pavement one evening you are not social person you need to reach\rout to people rather sitting at home. And now he says you better stay\rhere with your friends; me-Aarush will move to Hebbal. As with blatant\rnostalgia and sentimental heated arguments along with lots of ifs and\rbuts I was given option of selling this property but to which I didn\u0026rsquo;t\ragree with the thought that some day maybe it will get appraisal. It is\rsaid \u0026ldquo;home is where the heart is\u0026rdquo; and for me my heart is at Sherwood\rstill with my friends I made in these bygone years.\nIt took me long to make up my mind finally for the move. Strange\rright\u0026hellip;to hear this where people don\u0026rsquo;t want to move to their own\rapartment. Well,You heard it right. Here,medium of meeting people was\rthrough Aarush. At times I use to arrange small snack party or pot-luck\ror dinner\u0026hellip;.I won\u0026rsquo;t say party rather get-together. It was more of an\rattempt to meet working -non working mothers. Every time there was\raddition of 1 or 2 new face. Although at times there were friends with\rwhom views didn\u0026rsquo;t match in certain topics but still we kept meeting each\rother. I learnt a lot at same time subconsciously or otherwise about\rhuman behavior etc.\nIn turn I can\u0026rsquo;t say whether it was burden to them or not but they also\ruse to invite me be at religious purpose like haldi-kumkum or may be\rsimilar evening snacks party. One of the major get together use to be\rbirthday parties of kids. Almost every month we had at least one party.\rThis parties gave opportunity to kids to wait for their return gift even\rbefore giving the birthday gift as well cake cutting with lots of enthu.\nWell, at end I love the irony of my combined housewarming and my move\rget -together with friends in 2-3 sets where I gave them token of my\rremembrance to every one I knew and meeting them for one last time while\rstaying in that same community. As it was not possible for me to go to\reach and everyones place for dinner or lunch.\nMy sincere special thanks to Kalpana, Kanchan, Pragati, Harshu and Anita\rlastly but not least Neeti who despite of their busy schedule arranged\ran awesome dinner. Nevertheless to all my known acquaintances I will\rnever forget you and keep coming to Sherwood whether you guys come to\rvisit me in my new place or not.\n","excerpt":"This is our 4th move in last eight years.

It was a laborious,\rmonotonous job going through website after website, jotting down details\rregarding price. With heavy heart went in but found everything as per\rinternet photos only. We asked for next day car-hire for Shekhawati\rdaytrip which they arranged.\n30th Oct - Morning 7.00am nice, clean amby was provided to us and we\rstarted our day trip towards withering Land of kuber. On way we had\rhot tasty parantha idly as breakfast from Dhabba. It takes 3hrs to reach\rthat region. On way after talking to our cab driver we made our circuit\rstarting from towns like Fatehpur, Mandawa, Churi-Ajithgarh,\rDundlod, and Nawalgarh back to Jaipur.\nShekhawati is world renowned for its painted havelis and paintings,\rtheir frescos depicting mythological and historical themes. Actually,\rwhen the Marwaris made their first foray with the Maharajahs and\rThakurs, they found that there was money to be made from establishing\rbusiness in distant centres. Under the British their prosperity aspired\reven higher, and they took their business to Calcutta, mumbai and other\rpockets of influence. Tradition in those days was whoever made it good\rwould come back and build 4 things-haveli, baoli(well), mandir and\rdharamshala. With the money they made, they ordered lavish havelis\rback home and in order to make them attractive had them painted in what\rhas come to be defined as the Shekhawati fresco style. A sense of\rcompetitiveness brought in excess, since this provided the worth of the\rowner\u0026rsquo;s presumed wealth.\nToday’s eminent business group Birla, Goenka, Singhania, Poddar are all\rfrom Shekhawati region which has now immerged as open art painting\rgallery well preserving its historical heritage. Havelis are guarded at\rthe entrance by large wooden doors. Within these, a smaller door is\rnormally used for daily movements. Intricate wooden carvings with fancy\rbrass iron fittings demonstrating the owners’ wealth. The ground floor\ris normally recessed in such a way that balconies overhang the street.\rIt was from the latticed windows on the balconies and over the\rcourtyards that women were able to get a glimpse of the men’s world. The\rfacade, the gateways, the courtyard walls, the parapets and ceilings,\rwere all covered with frescoes.\nAll these paintings are made with natural colors. For example yellow\rwas also obtained by evaporating the urine of cows fed for ten days on\rnothing but mango leaves. The resulting paste was rolled into small\rround ‘gayagolis’ and produced a brilliant yellow when dilated with\rwater.\nThey used the ‘Fresco Buono’ technique - in this method only a\rpart of the wall was plastered at a time with three layers of very fine\rclay. Sketches were made on the walls scratching the outshines into the\rwet plaster with a sharpened stick. It remained without fading for\ralmost as long as the building lasted. A gum made from local plant or a\rderivative of camel fat was used as the crucial binding agent.\nAt Fatehpur main attraction was Nadine la Prince which is bought\rand restored by a French artist Nadine. At Mandawa its Castle\rMandawa besides Sneh ram ladia ,Gulab rai ladia haveli and\rJhunJunuwala golden painted haveli, Murmura and Double Goenka\rhaveli (we could not visit as it was closed) at Churi Ajithgarh it’s\rSheonarayans haveli at Dundlod its Goenka haveli and at\rNawalgarh its Poddar haveli.\nTIPS: Best way to visit this regions by own transport but still you\rneed to do a good amount of walking once you reach\rone particular destination. Hire guide(negotiable) to take you around.\rNo doubt beautiful painting, awesome architecture but one thing is sure\rat Shekhawati after craning your neck whole day long at end you feel\rlike every other painting is same. After sunset there is no sense to be\rthere as artificial light will be not sufficient enough to see the\rintricate painting details.\nWe skipped lunch to cover our itinerary and had very early dinner on way\rback to Jaipur and by 9.00pm we were at our hotel door.\n","excerpt":"29th Oct - We took SpiceJet flight to Jaipur but unfortunately could\rnot make it within time due to technical problems and traffic congestion\rwe were made to wait for 3 hrs inside flight.

We were looking for something near to\rbeach and thought of heading towards Pondichery but due to\runavailability of any sea facing hotel we opted of Auroville.\rCertain thing really happens for good. The road was Bangalore -\u0026gt; Krishnagiri -\u0026gt;\rTiruvanamalli -\u0026gt;Tindivanam-\u0026gt; Auroville.As usual Santanu had production outage @ work and went to sleep around 2\rAM thanks to ‘new era new tool’ at work. Started early morning around\r05.50; had breakfast at A2B (Krishnagiri) then around 07.50 we hit the\rroad. Non stop drive to Pondichery and reached around 13:00. The road\rbetween Krishnagiri and Tiruvanamalli is undivided state highway with\rlots of pot holes. You need to be very careful as most parts of the\rroads are good but suddenly you get one big pot holes. Road between\rTindivanam and Pondicherry is newly done 4 lane highway.\n\nWe booked our room at \u0026ldquo;Center Guest House\u0026rdquo; through the website\raurovilleguesthouse.org just two\rweeks ahead. They sent letter confirming it and with fine prints where\rwe were supposed to send the advance by Demand Draft now in the age of\rcredit cards we didn’t pay attention to the bottom part of the mail till\rday before the trip. On contacting over phone they said to come over as\rthere was no other booking. Their rates include meal for three times a\rday, bicycle and Yoga. . Its non-alcoholic and public smoking is\rstrongly discouraged; it is not a place for vacation – most come here to\rmeditate. Most Indian come and visit the Auroville as day trip from\rPondicherry.\nMe and my hubby fell in love seeing the place and particularly when they\rshowed our room which is tucked between trees and you can see\rbutterflies, birds. Was just mesmerized to see the greenery all around.\rHad Indian buffet lunch at dining hall and after relaxing for a while\rwent out to look for cycle. The dining hall had two baby chairs as well\rwhich is so uncommon in India.\nWe found one cycle which had baby chair fixed; most cycles were tall and\rtypical DESI type with hard seat. After maneuvering for a while I\rmanaged to get onto one finally as I am not used to these types of\rcycles; Voila\u0026hellip; We cycled here and there without thinking much and\rlooking at maps.\nBest part is they have so many trails that you will never be bored and\rthe same time you will not be lost. The roads are in spiral in Auroville\rjust like the Paris is planned. Greenery is all around, few houses and\rbuildings with lots of shades from tress to make it more pleasant. If\ryou feel you are lost in this forest ask anyone be Indian or foreigner\rthey will guide you. Most residents or visitors are from France as you\rcan hear French all around you.\n\nIts really place far off from city noise, pollution and traffic soaking\rin the best nature has to offer. Negative thing about Aurorville is you\rare forced to give up your fast paced city life. Everything gets closed\rfor lunch even lots of the facilities are only available for those who\rstay longer like 8-10 days. If you stay longer you get an Auroville\rcards which is like a pre-paid cash card but gives exclusive access to\rsome restaurants, café and others center like yoga.\nWe went to the visitor center and spent a good amount time in the\rvarious boutique shops and picked a school bag for Aarush. Once it\rstarted to get dark we headed back to Guest House. We all had shower as\rthis place is quite hot and humid. Had continental buffet dinner at\rnight they do serve early evening between 7.00 - 7:30 PM. By 10.00 PM\rthey expect to be pin drop silence so every one around is sleeping well.\rWe also slept early.\nDay -2 \nAfter breakfast we went to bicycle stand and found someone has taken\raway Pamela’s cycle and she has to find a new one all over again. Once\rwe started paddling we decided to go beach. The ride was a smooth one\rbut once we were off Green zone there were cars and as usual they did\rnot have any courtesy for cyclist. The 8 KM long ride was fun. The\raccess to the beach is not direct you need to access the trough a narrow\rlane. Both the lane and the beach are very dirty have not seen any thing\rdirtier than this.\nFrom beach we came to Visitor center and watched video on Matri\rmandir. For the first time visitor watching of the video is a must and\rafter that one gets a pass to the vista point to see Matri-mandir.\rInside access is rusticated but open to all who wish to meditate.\rAfter that we came back to guesthouse for lunch. Santanu decided\ragainst touching the car which means we had to postpone the trip to\rPondicherry for the last day of the trip. We went out with the cycle\raround 4 went to Solar\rKitchen to start\rwith. As Solar kitchen only except Auroville cards we could only smell\raroma of good food and see other enjoying with our stomach rumbling we\rleft that place. After riding the cycle till dark we came back to guest\rhouse and called it a day.\nDay-3 \nWe started early with quick breakfast and checkout by 9AM and headed\rtowards Pondicherry. The destination was French Quarter and Aurobindo\rAshram. We paid a quick visit to the Ashram. Children under 3 years\rare not allowed. After walking around French quarter we went to a\rrestaurant and Aarush had his breakfast brunch. There was nothing much\rto do in Pondicherry and we found it hotter than Auroville. We headed\rback to Auroville again for our lunch as we wanted to try Roma’s\rKitchen.\n\nThe food there was excellent one of the best pasta I had in India.\rThe place is frequented by non-Indians and we noticed they all were\rhaving Indian dishes.We enjoyed our Pasta while Aarush was too busy\rrunning and playing with two French girls who were bit older than him.\rHe was so happy that he was crying while we tried to put him car. By\r14:30 noon we started from there; the drive was OK and we reached\rKrishnagiri by 18:30. But from there to Bangalore was long journey as\rthere was a major accident on the road and we reached home at 21:30.\nIf you are looking for a doing nothing kind of a weekend Auroville is\rgreat. The best part is as most visitor who comes here from abroad lots\rof small things like baby chair; clean bathroom is common. The food is\rbit blend in Indian context but we liked it. People are courteous and\rhelpful.\n»More\rpictures \n","excerpt":"Almost\rafter one and half year we went for a long weekend out of Bangalore; our\rvery first road trip of 2010.

Confronting such family matters does not work as\rno one is right. Anyways, at times you are forced to go along with such\rdecision whether you like it or not.Plan to\rSunderban\rtrip was made by Santanu as we wanted to go somewhere around Calcutta\rnot just one Wedding to start with. And now with extension of our\rholiday we were left with 2 more days in hand. So after lots of thoughts\rand web browsing we settled unanimously for Puri - every Bengalis\rdream place or second home.\rDigha an eminent beach\rresort of West Bengal was shelved as everyone recommended against it.\n\n\nFrom Calcutta its one night train journey and reached Puri early morning\rby Puri express. Heard from lot of sources and found it in actuality too\rthat all kinds of people will start approaching you ,offering help\rstarting from getting hotel to visiting inside the temple by trying to\rrob you. Avoided these people as much as possible.\nWe booked for Hotel Santana which was not sea facing but not far\rfrom sea. It’s located on C.T. (Chakra Tirtha) Road where most\rnon-Indian prefer to stay. There are steady growth of foreigners in\rrecent years who find beaches of Orissa are more tranquil compared to\rthe famous one on western coast of India. Puri beach front is divided in\r3 sections starting from west you have the old hotels which are\rfrequented by Bengali’s; the middle section is a no-tourist-land as\rthere is a big gutter which opens at sea and at the end you have the C.T\rRoad where new hotels are.\nFirst\rthing for us after reaching hotel was to visit Jaganath temple. We\rasked our hotel people to arrange for darshan. They did it within\rhours time very kind of them. They told us not to pay any exorbitant\ramount to that person just anything you wish should be fine enough. I\rdidn\u0026rsquo;t know before that non-Hindus are not allowed inside the temple. We\rhad very smooth darshan despite lot of chaos and fight among police and\rpandas were going on just before closing of temple at noon. It didn\u0026rsquo;t\rtook much time too in queue compared to Tirupati.\nAfter\rdarshan we decided to come back and had lunch as we were empty stomach\rfrom morning so had food at one Jain place with no onion and garlic.\rThen strolled around in the street near to hotel. It was quite hot and\rbit humid at day time so went back to room. Rested for a while then left\rhotel on foot around 4.00pm to walk along the beach towards bazaar. Till\r8.00pm we were roaming around and then decided to come back as Aarush\rwas to be fed which was our concern. In evening we had temple bhog which\rwas huge chunk to be finished by two. You are not supposed to throw\rbhog we shared the untouched portion with our hotel staffs who were\ralso happy to have it. The Prasad is so holy that a Hindu Brahmin will\reat the same even an un-touchable saves the same from a dog’s mouth.\n\nNext day at 8.00am we left our room for Konark by a Cab from hotel\rand on reaching the spot hired a guide. The Guide was well informed and\rvery decent took around and an hour or so to explain and then we took\rour own time to look around. From there we came to Chandbaga (Konark\rgold) beach. Aarush jumped into sea and was not willing to come out but\rwe convinced him somehow that in evening we will come again. We came\rback to city center walked around temple area shopped some Saris and had\rfood there in one restaurant from where temple is seen very clearly.\n\nDid few shopping and came back to hotel. Then in evening as per our\rpromise we took Aarush to beach and he was very happy. At evening its\rcool breeze which makes you to stay long then we came to street side\rfood where we had fresh fish fry and hurried to hotel for Aarush\rbefore he gets cranky out of hunger.\nAt late night boarded train back to kolkata.\n","excerpt":"We had to extend our planned holidays as we\rgot a last minute invitation for my cousin\u0026rsquo;s marriage now both marriages\rwere only 6 days apart.

The traffic started to\rmove in snail pace and meanwhile Aaarush dozed off while seating in his\rcar seat. So from BTM we went to checkout Oyster Bath\rConcepts at Jaynagar showroom. Luckily\rthe rain stopped and we left Aarush for 5-10 minutes while sleeping as\rcar was parked right infront of the showroom. From there wanted to go to\rCommercial Street as rain almost stopped. But on the way it again\rregained its power and was splashing water all over. So we decided to\rkeep our feet dry and head towards home. It was a long detour to reach\rhome to be honest and only person benefited was Aarush as he completed\rhis afternoon nap. So at the end instead of going directly to home we\rwent to Sambit’s place and had a good time there.\n","excerpt":"The past weekend was very low key just wanted to laze around to be\rhonest.

Here you can find materials of every imaginable colors. Not only\rfabric but also carpet, prayer mats, jewelries oriental carpets,\rpashminas, sarong, batik shirts etc. I think you can BARGAIN!!!! but not\rsure. The shops here sell French Lace, Thai silk, Brocade, Indian Silk\rbuttons, and many more\u0026hellip;anything related to sewing.\n\nIt is a great stop to just walk around and see the shop house\rarchitecture of Singapore. Seemingly endless number of fabric shops\rstarts to make your head spin. On Baghdad street-there are a lot of new\rrestaurants/cafe houses. Many of the restaurants have sheeshas or water\rpipes, which you can smoke while having sip of coffee. We had kasha\rlaham for lunch at Cafe le Caire @ Al Majlis located at 39 Arab\rStreet which was for more than 2 person in terms of portion.\nAfter\rhaving heavy lunch we walked towards Bugis street but I missed the\rcharm of it as Santanu was not in mood for any more shopping. Its place\rfor shop-alcoholics with good street shopping experience. \nThen came to Raffles hotel to see its colonial style architecture.\rIt houses museum shops, tropical garden courtyard and Victorian-style\rtheater, tiffin room among many others. Best part is at raffles you will\rbe first welcomed by a Sikh doorman dressed in white ironed Grieves\rand Hawks uniforms with thick mustache as you get down from your car. It\ris impossible to overlook the doorman dressed in traditional Sikh\rattire. But what is fascinating is the fact that they are one of the\rmost photographed icons of Singapore.\n\nThen visited raffles mall and after strolling for a while decided to\rreturn to our mandarin hotel as Santanu'\u0026rsquo;s flight was ahead of us.\rYes\u0026hellip;you heard it right..we had different flight on way back as well.\nWhile going from here to Singapore it was smooth journey with Aarush but\ron way back it was really terrible as flight was fully packed and with\rtime difference and whole day moving around he was cranky enough.

Got down by MRT at China\rtown \u0026amp; took exit to Pagoda street. One can\u0026rsquo;t miss the colorful row of\rshop-houses along that street, with baby blue and yellow flowers painted\rall over.

So walked straight to Buddha tooth\rrelic temple \u0026amp; museum. It took us 2 hrs to complete the whole. It was\rworth the visit.\n\nNext to this place was Sago street. At end of sago street is china\rtown complex. The most interesting part of the Complex is the wet\rmarket, located at its basement. The Chinese are reputed to eat\reverything from hoof to tail, and there\u0026rsquo;s no better place to witness\rthis than a market in the heart of Chinatown! You will be greeted by the\rsight of turtles, eels, pig trotters, live frogs being skinned and a\rfascinating array of fresh meat and seafood. Colorful tropical fruits\rand vegetables are abundant. There are also dry and preserved goods\rstalls selling a myriad of Chinese culinary needs from sharks' fin to\rcentury eggs. The market is busiest and at its best in the morning as\rtold by one shopkeeper. I boycotted this part as I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to eat\ranything later.\n\n\nTook left turn to Terengganu Street which ends at Pagoda street. This\rstreet is crammed with shops selling clothes, antiques, wood carvings,\retc. The goods are not sold at fixed prices, so one can test bargaining\rskills here. But while walking around I came across one juice shop\rselling juices of cactus to orange. Decided to have Bitter Gourd\rjuice just for change. Not bad though.

For today I have\ralready decided to go to Botanical garden in first half of the day.\rSo took a cab from hotel and I figured it was very nearby. This\rbotanical garden is must if you want to see the greenery and variety of\rplants and flowers they have. Excellent maintenance, people come here\rfor jogging, picnic and touristy purpose. They have one section of\rNational orchid garden which is just awesome. After strolling for\rfew minutes I realized that battery of my camera has not been charged\rfor past 2 days and unfortunately after a while in major area of Orchid\rgarden my camera stopped working. With orchid garden they have number of\rmini- attractions. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t take any photo of mist house,\rcool-house. Other than that they have rain-forest, ginger garden,\revolution garden. Then they have 3 lakes: Swan Lake, Symphony Lake and\rEco Lake. Then even have French restaurant and cafeteria in the garden.\rIt takes at least more than 2 hrs. to complete round of the garden.\n\nAt certain places they have flight of stairs where I have to carry\rAarush as well the stroller up and down. Otherwise, overall pavement is\rvery good for kids in stroller and handicapped people. I decided to\rreturn by public bus so got down at orchards street close to hotel. Went\rto hotel room put the batteries in charger. Meanwhile we freshened up,\rfed my son and put him to sleep. Then around 4.00pm I took metro while\rhe was still sleeping and went to Raffles place by MRT.\n\nFrom here I walked towards boat quay seeing parliament, supreme court,\rcity hall building and Saint Andrews cathedral on the way. My\robjective was to see Merlion. So walked all the way on the riverside\rlined with restaurants basically hangout for expatriates and tourists\rwith chic cafes, yuppie pubs. Here every restaurant employee tries to\rpersuade you to come in. While strolling saw structure of arts along\rthe river which was amazing. Walked all the way till the back of The\rFullerton hotel then crossed highway to go to other side i.e., one\rFullerton to Merlion park tourist icon of Singapore.\nAs\rlocated next to marina bay on city\u0026rsquo;s edge it has seating arrangement to\rview Esplanade, sea and bum-boats to give tourists a tour of Colonial\rSingapore from the river. Me and Aarush sat there relaxing my feet after\ra hard day of walking. It was about to sunset \u0026amp; weather was very\rpleasant, chill air blowing.\nWhile sitting there I was gazing people from different corners of world\rcoming and posing with Merlion. One big Japanese group came; and they\rwere posing like anything and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t control laughing all alone;\rtruly had a fun time. After a while I realized that we too also became\rtourist icon with Merlion as some of those Japanese women in late 40s\rwanted to have picture with me and Aarush (taklu baby) too.\n\nWell, with the fall of day-light statue is floodlit and water pours from\rthe statue\u0026rsquo;s mouth. Fortunately we spent quite a lot of time there as it\rwas today’s end point. Around 8 Santanu met us there and we left for\rdinner by cab to Little India.\nToday we had south Indian thali; portion of food was too much to eat\rthen we walked to Mustafa known shopping complex open 24 hrs. I\rbelieve They mainly serve tourists from India, Middle East, South-east\rAsia and Africa other then Europeans and Americans. They have wide range\rof items from pin to piano thronging with narrow aisles. Staffs don\u0026rsquo;t\rrespond properly except in diamond-gold jewelery section and most of\rthem can\u0026rsquo;t speak simple English neither they have product knowledge. Its\rheavily crowded even at 12.00AM.After a while I started feeling dizzy\rdue to claustrophobia. Then quickly bought few stuffs and headed back to\rhotel via public bus.\n","excerpt":"We woke up bit early; had heavy breakfast as usual.

We decided\rto go for Jurong bird park and offbeat track -Kong Meng San Phor\rKark See Monastery, is the largest monastery in Singapore.\nWe had breakfast at ChatterBox as the normal breakfast side was packed.\rThe menu was quite different from the normal side as we had lots of\rtraditional dishes to choose from. As usual Pamela had lots of dim-sum\rand I preferred the usual cereal and fruits.\n\nWe started with the monastery, and when Orchard road tourist info office\rthey were bit of surprised with our choice. The nearest MRT stop is\rBishan and from there we took bus no 410. It took around 1 1/2hrs to\rcomplete the same. We enjoyed the serenity of that place painted in\rbright colors.\n\nFrom there we went to Jurong bird park via MRT. This MRT journey is\rvery long as covers almost whole Singapore Northern part. On the way we\rpicked Zongzi (or zong)\rtraditional Chinese food, made of glutinous rice stuffed with different\rfillings; we had red bean paste. It is tetrahedral shape and wrapped in\rbamboo or reed leaves where leaf imparts its own unique smell and flavor\rto the rice. They are cooked by steaming or boiling. After a long wait\rgot into 194 SBS bus from Boonlay metro station by that the sky\rwas already dark with afternoon clouds. As soon as we reached park gate\rit was almost 4 PM abut luckily rain stopped.\nIt is open concept park which houses some thousand birds. We started our\rwalk from on left side of ticket counter followed by crowned pigeon-\rWorld’s Largest Pigeons. They are at tree-top level with walkway which\roffers a completely unobtrusive view of the birds since there are no\rwire meshes separating the visitor from the birds. Then they have large\rcollection of horn-bills and toucans. Lory Loft showcases the Lorykeet\rwhere Visitors can enter, traverse and exit Lory Loft at treetop level,\rallowing for a bird eye’s view of the majestic panorama.\nThe bird shows at the Pools Amphitheater featuring flamingos, macaws,\rhornbills and cockatoos are both spectacular and funny we heard from\rothers but we couldn\u0026rsquo;t watch any as reached there late afternoon.\rAfrican Waterfall Aviary, home to free-flying African birds and parrots\rparadise we missed. They have air conditioned panorail system with\rstoppages which covers the entire Park providing excellent elevated\rviews.\nThey have birds of prey section too then ostrich, Double-Wattled\rCassowary, Emu followed by Dino Dig which allows children and family\rmembers to experience archaeological diggings together and discover\rfossils hidden through time amidst the sands. It is entertaining for\rboth adults as kids.\nFrom there we walked towards riverine featuring ducks, fishes and\rturtles, swan and pelican cove and then flamingo .Penguin Parade\renclosure, in a re-created Antarctic setting is worth seeing from kids\rpoint of view. Shoe bill, African crane, saddle billed storks and then\rat last we entered world of darkness which houses different species of\rowl.\n\n TIP: Scrolling around the park would take more than 2-3 hours.\rSo make sure to come earlier so that you can spend more time\rmingling with birds. And one can still have time to relax in one of\rtheir huts while watching the birds and listening to their symphony.\rPersonally, seen different kinds of birds only in pictures and\rbooks. It really awakens our childhood desires. My son enjoyed a\rlot. We had to carry stroller up and down the stairs many a times.\rAlthough it was bit tiring but MUCH better on foot, at our own pace.\rOverall, spent fabulous day with birds of different species from\rdifferent countries at one place. Best part is the whole area is\rvery green and serene.\n \nThey have unique restaurant as all the chairs are made of metal with\rdifferent kinds of animal figures. As well one can\u0026rsquo;t miss their souvenir\rshop as it is at EXIT door. Instead of wounding up by taking the bus to\rMRT we hired a cab for our hotel; got freshened up then left for dinner\rat Lau Pa Sat known for satay and stingray under the stars.\n","excerpt":"After a full day @ Santosa on Sunday we woke up pretty late.

The initial plan was to attend Papai’s wedding reception and\rtravel to some where around like Digha and back to Bangalore. We got our\rBangalore – Calcutta ticket booked. Going was by train to save money and\rreturn was on flight so that we save time \u0026amp; energy before getting back\rto our daily routine.\nNow people suggested against Digha and we settled for Sunderban.\rAccording to guide the place has not changed a lot - land where past\rlives in present and is not yet well connected well to Kolkata. We went\rthrough travel guide book and settled with Kali Travels. This travel\rcompany is run by two Australians out of Calcutta – David and\rMartyn.\n\nWe chose for 2 night 3 days package with them. So on the day Martyn\rshowed up on time with a Innova. On our way out of Calcutta he briefed\rthe plan for next 2 days.\nAs soon as we took the road out from Science City junction of EM bypass\rthe landscape changed drastically. I felt as if I was on time machine.\rThe small villages and rural bazaar on way reminded me of remote North\rEastern part of India from my childhood which sounds surreal but true.\rLooks like in last 40 years of left-front government there is hardly any\rprogress on their so called strongholds. The car dropped us at\rSonakhali (approx 60 KM from Calcutta).\nWe had to wait there as was no immediate boat for Gosoba our\rdestination. It was 26th Jan(Republic day) and there was not much\rhappening at the river front. This allowed us to explore the adjacent\rvillage market. Found cobbler who are still selling stripes for rubber\rHawaii sandals, reminded that uncommon in urban India where people\rprobably changes their sandals if the strips is broken.\nThe boat was almost empty it was us and few passengers and the journey\rtook almost an hour. As motor boat begins to sail towards its\rdestination the scenery gradually changed from rural village evoking\rfeelings of excitement, adventure and anticipation of unknown. We\rreached Gosoba - peak of afternoon had lunch and walked through the\rmarket. We got into the man pulled cycle-van rickshaw with flat bed to\rsit and put our luggage too. As it was our first time 6 KM long journey\rseemed never ending. Gosoba is one of the big island in Sunderban. There\ris no real electricity here, every machine that needs electricity runs\ron generator. There is no car or auto(Tuktuk) only few motorcycles which\rrun on bio-fuel. Life seems less complicated in one sense but I was\rgetting full EDGE signal on my Blackberry.\n\nWe stayed at Apanjan Hotel at Pakhiralya which is just opposite to\rSajnekhali Tiger Reserve. One can see the tiger reserve entrance\rfrom this side of bank. At dusk went for village walk. Here most of\rhouses are made of mattir ghor- house of mud which keeps it cool and\rwalking through those winded narrow lanes we realized that we have\rbecome center of attraction. The attraction was two fold for the locals\ras we brown skin who shares a common mother tongue of the local along\rwith tall blond fair skin Australian as their guide. But looked like\rMartyn is quite well known as “Uncle” to the local people. And they will\rconverse in broken Bengali-English and lots of sign languages and catch\rup on their whereabouts.\nAarush was very busy chasing the stray dogs which were hanging around\rthe hotel. And he went to sleep as soon as he finished his dinner. We\rhad a simple Bengali dinner and chatted with Martyn on lots of\rsubjects.As night begins to slip in the lullaby of mother nature, the\rmusic of blowing wind, distant call of restless wild life and rustling\rof branches gently put you to sleep as even generators are switched off\rby 10.00PM. Life in noisy city will drift away becoming a distant\rmemory.\n\nNext day woke up around 7ish and after breakfast got into boat and went\rto Sajnekhali Forest depertment to register ourselves. They assigned\rus one (compulsory) guide to show us around and enjoy a day cruise by\rboat through the creeks and canals of the dense forest. This hunting\rland is ruled by forest goddess Bonobibi to whom prayers are offered\rin order to maintain communal harmony between man \u0026amp; animal. So we too\roffered our prayers before starting our journey.\n\nWe saw lots of birds to start with displaying riots of colors and sounds\rand must admit few times we could not locate the camouflaged birds\runless our guide with eagle eye pointed it. Egret, kingfisher, red\rvented bulbul, eagle, brahmini kite,brown winged kingfisher, indian\rroller, pond heron etc were spotted. There was baby crocodile who was\rbasking in the winter sun as our boat approached he swam along the boat\rfor a while before sinking altogether. While cruising we sighted water\rmonitor lizard other than wild boars.\n\nOn spotting wild boar we realized suddenly our camera failed and was not\rresponding to any button we pressed. Here the majestic king royal\rbengal tiger are endowed with good swimming power as told by our guide\rand are man eaters. We traced tiger paws while cruising along the\rmangrove covered banks.Well there are only few hundreds left in\rSunderban and new census was going on while we were there. We heard\rfire-shots from Forest Officials who were in one of unmanned island\rcollecting tiger poo(shit) to identify unique tigers. Earlier they used\rto get the claw molded in Plaster of Paris – as each tiger has unique\rclaw just like our finger prints.\n\nOur boat journey ended around 13:00 hrs. All along it was low tide which\rmeans you have better chance of spotting any wild life as more surface\rareas gets exposed.Actually both high and low tide has their own\rpros-cons. During high tide boat enters various creeks weaving in and\rout allowing to explore most forbidden areas of sunderbans. We stopped\rat watch towers where one can disembark and experience nature at its\rpurest.While leaving from that point we saw some spotted deer and tried\rto capture it with Blackberry’s camera – what a luck!!!\nAfter a day of adventure, had lunch thereafter Pamela \u0026amp; Aarush took\rsiesta. I sat back and relaxed while discussing with Martyn his\rexperience in China as a visiting Professor of English. Well his side of\rstory is quite shocking as I never heard first hand experience on that\rmatter.\nIn the evening we went for walk but it was dark. Lucky us as of full\rmoon moon-light was enough to show us the way and we did not needed the\rtorch most of the time. While walking we heard soundtracks from Hindi\rmovies of 86/87’s played in distance causing havoc to the beautiful\rsilence. It was surprising how much distance a noise can travel in a\rsilent land.\nThe devastation from Aila (cyclone of 2009) can be still seeen;\rground water is salty; when you wash your face for the first time you\rget real shock. The locals are yet trying to get back to their lives.\rBut looks like there is hardly any or no-help help from government on\rthat front. Lots of those broken dams needs quick fix before another\rfloods hits this area.Potrait of words done by Amitabh Gosh on his\rfamous novel \u0026quot; hungry tide\u0026quot; looks so real, people are really with big\rheart. The poorest one lives in the mud house next to dam where\rrelatively well off stay inland. But as whole they are still backward in\rmany terms.\nAs Aarush had a nap he refused to go to sleep early. There were only one\rcouple from (Sweden) other then us in the hotel with a young noisy\rNepali Guide. The guide arranged for a bonfire for them once the\rgenerator was put off at 10 PM. The tourist retired early while we\renjoyed both the bonfire and moon-light from our balcony.\nSomehow I felt bad as we started to pack our bags as I knew we were\rheading back to crowded madness of the city life soon. The boat was\rpacked already when we reached Gosoba and it left immediately after we\rboarded. Me and Aarush took a privilege seat on the top of toilet but\runder shade. Aarush was not much happy with this arrangement – he was\rhungry as he refused to have his breakfast at hotel. So had some cheese\rand orange with me. But after 30 minutes or so I had to reunite with\rPamela who was seating on the boat roof exposed to Sun. It was quite hot\rif you have to seat for long in Sun. So reached Sonakhali after almost\r48 hours. Now had to wait for a while as we reached before expected time\rfor our car to arrive.\n\nThe car came within 20 minutes or so and Aarush fall asleep after he\rfinished a quick lunch.\nWell if you like to travel and open to the ideas of exploring must\rsuggest you to try Sunderban. On the economic front I am sure you can\rsave a lot if you go by yourself. But we enjoyed going with Kali Travels\rand suggest you do the same if you have extra cash to spare. Binocular,\rsun-cap, umbrella, mosquito repellent and torch are must to be taken in\rthis trip.\n","excerpt":"For the first time in my life I spent more than 2 nights in a row at\rCalcutta.

We planned for complete\rday-trip; as usual after heavy breakfast we went by metro to Harbour\rFront MRT station. From there took Sentosa Express (Monorail train)\rfrom Vivocity mall’s top floor. Once out of Beach station (last\rstop) we saw two queues for trams- one blue line queue to take the tram\rto Palawan and Tanjong beach and other green line to Siloso\rbeach. We preferred for first one as it was less crowded. Today it was\rmore relaxing for me as Santanu was there to take care of Aarush. And\rAarush was also happy to see many kids around him.\n\nThe main highlight of the Tanjong beach is the suspension boardwalk that\rbrings you to the Southernmost Point of Continental Asia which is also\rknown as the closest point to the Equator in Asia. A bit tricky\rgeography as Singapore is connected to Malaysia by a bridge it is not\rconsiders as an island and same true for Sentosa which is again\rconnected to Singapore by a bridge; reminded me of those great signs of\rWestern USA. We chilled and tried to get connect with nature as much we\rcan in those tall shady coconut trees and beautiful bougainvilleas\raround. Aarush was so excited to see water that he just wanted to jump\rand Santanu told him very tight while he dipped himself in sea. It was\rnot sufficient for him and ultimately he has to strap Aarush in the\rstroller. From Tanjong we came by walking to Palawa beach where we\rcouldn’t control Aarush anymore. There is a small fountain square or\rwading pool for kids to play beside seaside. He played happily without\rbothering even we are around or not for almost 2 hrs; then we forcibly\rtook him out as it started to rain.\nThis island is simply beautiful and bustling with activities. It houses\rmany museums, theatres, aquariums, luxury shops and of course beaches.\rHad very light Indian lunch and then left for Silosa beach. There we\rvisited underwater world which was equally fun. Underworld is one of\rexpensive attraction of Santosa (S$22 per ticket) but it really worth\rthe money. Next to the aquarium is the show of dolphins but due to rain\rit was cancelled and we have to be happy with the show from sea-lions.\n\nFrom there we took a bus to tiger sky tower, images of Singapore and\rMerlion. These attractions are sited so close together that you need not\rspend more than 5 minutes to walk from one attraction to another. The\reasiest way to get to Imbiah Lookup is by Sentosa Express, a monorail\rtrain which will bring you directly to Imbiah Lookup station.\rFinally, after whole day walking and stalking my son slept and we too\rdecided to relax while gazing at the serenity of the sea so comeback by\rmonorail to last stop as we had bought ticket for last show of the day.\rBefore Aarush went to sleep he was really cranky and was doing all kind\rof real naughty things, ultimate one was he just lied down completely on\rthe pavement to lodge his complaint like a street activist.\nWe ended our trip with one of the highly-rated show, Song of the Sea\rwhere the highlight is on fountain-like water spray dancing harmoniously\rwith the background music. In addition, to colourful lighting which\rchanges constantly with the rhythm of the background music it is\renhanced with lasers, pyrotechnics, bursts of fire, water jets, pop\rmusic and a live cast, the show is more like a state-of-the-art\rentertainment. After show we left for Vivocity for return journey to\rhotel.\n\nWe had our dinner at Vivocity food republic; place bubbling with energy.\rIt’s the place for the food connoisseurs. They have wide range of\rinternational cuisine and restaurants serving French, Italian, Japanese,\rTaiwanese local flair and what not. We had java and fried Hakeem\rnoodles\u0026hellip;which was absolutely awesome.\n","excerpt":"Saturday, we planned for Sentosa Island – Sentosa is the top tourist\rattraction if you ask any Singaporean tourist information or locals.\rSentosa has it all – beach, corporate team building activities,\raquarium, great food and entertainment and soon there will be Casio and\rentertainment park with roller coaster rides.

Me and Aarush after shower around 11am left\rour hotel room. Today again we walked on other side of Orchard\rStreettill Dhoby Ghat Station. Now\ra days; I too feel sick like my hubby when too much time spent at malls\r… am I growing old ? :D It was good to be in mall when it is raining.\rOn otherhand, it also allows you to enjoy the air-condition in the\rstores as outside it is really hot and humid when not raining. We\rvisited malls after mall Paragon, Orchard central, Specialist\rShopping Centre (John Little store), Plaza Singapura etc flanked on Orchard street. This street\ris one of the best place to spend during any time of the year specially\rduring year end when the whole stretch of the street and the buildings\rare beautifully adorned with Christmas decors and lights.\nHad hot piping dumpling soup at lunch while my son slept at street\rshop.Then continued walking past official residence of Singapore\rPresident, the Istana which is next to Plaza Singapora Mall. There\rI picked a local SIM card in the same mall so that I can talk to my\rhubby at least in need. Lastly, couldn’t stop myself on seeing\rCarrefour French hyper store after long time at same mall. Bought some\rerrands and returned around 6-ish to the hotel.\nHubby too returned from office early being Friday around 7 ish; then we\rtogether left for dinner at Clark quay. Everyone were in weekend\rparty mood. This area is lined with bars and notable restaurants like\rHooters and others strung together, looking somewhat identical. Many\rwaterfront restaurants to enjoy (Thai, Indian, Chinese \u0026hellip;) food one\rwants to. They all have large covered patios that extend even further\runcovered. G-MAX reverse bungee, River cruises and river taxies on the\rSingapore River can be accessed from Clarke Quay.\n\nWe chose Riverside Jumbo restaurant. Open air seating near the\rwaterfront; its relaxing place for long chats while savoring seafood\rdishes after a long day of walking. We ordered steamed prawns with\rduck sauce as starter. Instead of popular and common Chili Crab\rwhich has more gravy we ordered black pepper crab a dry variant.\rTaste wise Black Pepper Crab is dry and spicy! Very yummy! Its Crispy\ron the outside, light and fluffy on the inside.\n\nThis was my fist experience with crab; learned one thing that they are\rdelicious but messy to eat. Not the most elegant food to eat as they\rserve with a bib and trust me - unless you eat crab regularly you\u0026rsquo;ll get\rit absolutely everywhere. Literally struggled during the whole course\rwhere the waitress kept on changing plates. Both hands got quite dirty\rbut thankfully they kept a bowl with warm water and plenty of napkins to\rkeep oneself clean. Santanu guided and helped me in cracking the crab.\rHe told me that pickers generally used to split the shell or push the\rmeat out with a long, thin tong. At times I felt like in a\rbio-laboratory to dissect this crabs and in this long process lost my\rappetite. We need to use fingers in order to fully savour the crab.\nWe ordered some Chinese buns (man tou) for Aarush which did not liked\rit much so we finished those on behalf of him. Next time, will\rdefinitely like to try the chilli crabs. As Aarush only had yogurt and\rsome side dish we got french fries for him which he had while running\rnear Clarke Quay riverside.\nLinkswww.jumboseafood.com.sg\n","excerpt":"On Friday we woke up early; had\rbreakfast- an elaborate one.

Actually this\rjourney is because of Santanu who went almost every year after returning\rto India. Each time after his official trip he use to complain about his\rloneliness and etc. So this time we made sure to accompany him. But what\ra luck! he was damn busy in his office. He use to leave hotel early in\rthe morning and come late at night. It was me and Aarush who were left\rto explore Singapore of our own.\nWe reached Singapore on Thursday morning, on our way to hotel we figured\rthat its extremely green country with no single patch left just like\rthat. Had our buffet breakfast till throat and hit the bed to overcome\rjetlag. We slept till 4.00PM Singapore local time. Straight I went to\rwindow of my room on 30th floor and surprised to see natures tears\rrolling down from mournful burdened grey clouds and people carrying\ropen umbrellas. I cursed myself that I got rains along with me from\rBangalore as it was pouring the day we left from there.\n\nLazily me and my son took shower and left the hotel around 6pm. Our\rhotel Mandarin Meritus was on Orchard Street; I preferred to know my\rneighborhood first. So, walking on that street felt like walking on\rChamps-Elysées of Paris with only difference that former is full of\rmalls one after another while later is full of shops from branded\rcompany. All these malls have branded showrooms; labels like Louis\rVuitton, Prada, Cartier, Dior and Giorgio Armani you name it its all\rthere in one street.\nIt seems that Christmas preparations started earlier. Whole street was\ralready decorated in Christmas mood; spotted so many caricatures along\rthe road on pavement; a huge Christmas tree at shopping extravaganza\rION Orchard and lots more Christmas decorations outside and inside\rother Malls. The architecture of the Ion orchard building is something\rdifferent compared to other malls in Orchard road. The facade is formed\rof huge glass bubbles.\nFor my son, whole thing was absolutely new, he was behaving like a\rhero of Bollywood who just came from very remote village to a big\rcity. He was too excited to see all these hustling bustling city life. Near Orchard metro they have colorful fountains dancing with light. He\renjoyed so much so that he completely drenched himself.\nIt seems People too were in festive mood carrying shopping bags in each\rhand. After strolling on that busy Orchard Street we headed to hotel as\rmy son\u0026rsquo;s clothes were wet and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to take risk with his health\rat new place and massacre my holidays.\n\nOn returning to room Santanu was already there busy on phone call\rmeeting. By the time my son had some food and slept again. It was almost\r11 when Santanu had finished his phone call. Had dinner at youth park;\rback of our hotel. We had Stingray (a common Singaporean dish) with\rrice and Stir Fried kangkung (water Spinach). We walked around to\rlocate nearest metro station and Santanu showed me about how to follow\rbus-route.\n","excerpt":"Viewing Singapore through a lens of mother of 22 months old baby was not\rfun all the time but enjoyed our stay there for 9 days.

May be god wanted me to experience the same. Few days back\rSantanu suddenly decided to visit before his upcoming hectic weeks at\roffice. So it was kind of planned-unplanned trip. Why unplanned\rknowingly was\u0026hellip;.we didn\u0026rsquo;t had any ticket in hands before starting the\rjourney nor we had any references to make use of. As planned, we were to\rstart early morning at 5 but when we woke up to the alarm ring I could\rhear tiny shards of crystals falling from the sky against leaves, trees\rand windows. I woke Santanu- he looked at the time, then towards the\rwindow and back to clock. The clock said it was 4.15am but it was dark\routside. Bed was warm and comfortable so he puts again the alarm back\rfor 5.00am. This time we both jumped out of bed with the alarm ring. We\rkept our things packed last night only so last minute final touch up was\rleft with packing which Santanu did; while I got dressed up and fed\rAarush in his sleep. By 6.00 we were at our parking lot.\n\nThe route that we took for Tirupati was Bangalore – Kolar\r–Mulbagilu - Palamneru - Chittoor – Tirupati. Road till Kolar is not\rthat excellent as of ongoing construction. Because of which we missed\rWoody\u0026rsquo;s restaurant and moreover my son was in deep sleep. So decided to\rmake a stop at Cafe-Coffee Day for restroom. Foods are highly pricey\rbut excellent in terms of neatness. Still Aarush was sleeping blissfully\rand we didn’t wanted to disturb him as when he is in sleep its good for\rdriving by accelerating. Took one take away coffee for Santanu from\rcafe-coffee day and we were on our way. After 10 we stopped at BANS\rrestaurant near Chittoor had our breakfast there; (prices were\rreasonable and very neat place) and were back at road. Landscapes are\rreally worth seeing particularly on sunny day but unfortunately weather\rwas bad that day. On way at Palamneru check post one police man stopped\rus seeing our Maharashtra number plate car and asked for 100 rs as we\rwere going to Tirupati\u0026hellip;strange! Was that we were going for fun or\rhoneymoon that he thought so? We declined saying give us a receipt for\rthe same or leave us. We reached Tirupati around 11.00am. Tirupati,\ris the temple town in Chittor District of Andhra Pradesh, located in the\rfoothills of Tirumala. And Tirumala is famous for the shrine Lord\rVenkateshwara.\nSantanu decided to go to Tirumala to get the tickets for darshan first\rand later look for hotel at foothill. So we straight away went towards\rhill after scanning our baggage and paying toll of Rs 20.Road is one way\rand really superb to drive through with scenic beauty around .It took 25\rmin. to reach there. Till this point every thing went smoothly now\ractual part starts that how and where to get ticket with less wait time\rin queue for darshan. Best part is nobody knows exactly; everyone will\rsay something different. Through internet study we knew that Vaikuntam\rQueue Complex- (is a series of inter-connected halls that leads to the\rmain temple) will give ticket of Rs. 300 for (Seeghra Darshan) fast\rdarshan but actuality is that you get into queue immediately without\rknowing when you can see lord while if you buy tickets of Rs. 50 and Rs.\r100 it is given according to availability of ticket on that particular\rday with no guarantee on time spent on queue. So one person there told\rus to go to Vijaya bank for fast darshan. Then we drove back near to\rbus stand where Vijaya bank is after searching here n there. The people\rnear counter have hardly any time to explain about anything. Its like\ryou buy ticket or get lost kind of. Anyways at counter he said he has\rticket for same evening nothing for Sunday morning. We wanted for Sunday\rearly morning so that after shower we can pay our obeisance as it was\rour 7th anniversary. As of man proposes and god disposes, we bought\rticket blindly for that evening of 1000 bucks without understanding any\rhead or tail. This time biometrics (finger printing and photo) were\rtaken to eliminate the involvement of middlemen, I believe.\n\nOn getting tickets on hand we saw it was written Sahasra\rDeepalankarana Seva at kovulu mandapam infront of temple at 5.30 pm\rwith 5 small laddus free. And maximum no. of people allowed for this is\r5. Now we started looking for temple as it was already 2.30 PM and at\rtirumala for everything there is a big line be it for ticket counter,\rladoo counter, tonsure, restroom etc. We crossed on the way Ram Bagicha\rGuest House(aka RBGH), maths, kalyan mandapam etc then also could not\rfigure out where the temple is as of misty weather. Then we asked one\rperson who guided us to Ram Bagicha entrance and told to ask there. At\rRam bagicha on asking security personnel he told us to go to\rbuilding next to Ram Bagicha- 3. Till then we were not sure whether we\rwere in temple premises or not as temple\u0026rsquo;s gold overlaid gopuram was\rnot visible because of rain. The crowd, queue all together makes the\rrains a harrowing experience. Moreover in our ado we forgot to take our\rumbrella. On asking same person about head tonsuring he said it’s done\rjust at side downstairs of Rambagicha. I had a strong belief that\rtonsuring being so famous that must be done with some mantra ucharan\rbut in actuality nothing like that. With Rs. 10 coupon we got one barber\rto get Aarrush\u0026rsquo;s head tonsured. There hands are so experienced that they\rdid it in few minutes while my son kept crying frantically. Thereafter\rbarber was again asking for more money which we denied.\nOn asking a temple worker at that hall he told one small puja of half an\rhour will be performed there as of rain and after collecting one silk\rUttariyam and blouse piece along with prasadam we need to stand in\rqueue to get glimpse of lord. As it was already 3.30 we decided to feed\rAarush with idli just opposite that hall but he strongly denied after\r1-2 morsel which we two later finished. And by 4.00 we went to that hall\rwhere they made us sit.Best part was since we were before time we got\rchance to sit in first row. Strangely, one temple worker gave us\rsomething to apply in forehead which we took with the thought that we\rmight be only one lacking it but oh my gosh\u0026hellip;next moment he asked for\rmoney. We declined to give any money. Truly, till this point we were\rfeeling like something fraud going on with us; people keep trying to\rdupe you. Then mustering enough courage I asked person sitting beside\rme showing our ticket he told that he has also the same and not to worry\rwe will be able to see lord at last. In the midst of Vedic chanting and\rsinging of Sankirtanas which was live telecasted we were astonish to\rsee priests with three thick chains one large pendant hanging near his\rbelly-button other then ear ring, golden watch strap, wristlet\u0026hellip;.o\r\u0026hellip;god real money making place not to be mentioned. A priest with chain\rand ear ring is quite common there.\n\nAfter half an hour we rushed along with others for queue; various sign\rboards indicate the location of the room where pilgrims need to report\rfor their darshan or seva. Outside the room, ticket is checked along\rwith the biometric data provided at the time of ticket purchase. It was\r6.15 when we entered this hall we waited for 10 min. I believe this was\rthe last hall of VQC; Once the gates exiting the halls are opened, the\rdevotee joins the actual queue, and from this point in the queue it\rtakes about 60–90 minutes (standing/walking) to reach the sanctum\rsanctorum and have Darshan. Just before entering the temple, there is\ra bridge connecting Queue complex to Temple where baggage are\rscanned for last time. The patience to keep moving step by step, for\rhours together is ultimate one.All you can see here is the tonsured\rheads be it male or female and people chanting\rGooovinda\u0026hellip;Gooovinda. Anyways after moving on endless queue with\rlong wait we reached sanctum sanctorum where people crushed us on from\revery side which is unexplainable. Near to sanctum felt like stuck in\runmoving queue. Even my little son couldn\u0026rsquo;t control his tears he just\rburst out (out of hunger, claustrophobia, with madness crushing from all\rsides). At times waiting in a queue felt like God simply refused to see\rus. On reaching inside officials were pushing devotees to one side\rbefore one can have proper sight of lord. Lastly, that momentary\rglimse of lord arrived where before we could fold our hands we found\rourselves at one corner. All the while I felt like asking god only this\rmuch fraction of seconds you have for your devotees who are dying to see\ryou.\nLiterally, I have to struggle with my memories to recollect lord\u0026rsquo;s face.\rThen with crowd came out saw golden hundi offered our bare minimum\rdakshinas and then took one round of temple then again formed a queue to\rcollect prasadam chakkera-pongali (sweet pongal) which was hot enough\rfor that cold rainy day. From there followed sign of ladoo counter\rwhich is again very commercialized. You need to buy poly bags for rs 2.\rThen stand in designated queue depending on type of ticket you bought.\rThank god our had less queue so got almost instantly. We wanted to buy 2\rmore extras but couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure out how and where to collect coupons for\rthe same.Well, satisfied with what we had and happy enough that God at\rleast wished to see us in this form without bath and without wasting\rmuch time in queue. It was 7.15 pm when we took exit from temple so one\rhour exactly from the time we were in queue.\n\nWorth visiting without any plan all because of Gods grace may be. We\rdecided to stay that night at Fortune keenness hotel @ Tirupati\rjust opposite the bus stand. Drove down-hill carefully which is again\rone way. Roads are really good here with a view of city. Although\rconsidered to be 4 star but room 116 provided to us had a roof with\rwater dripping due to extra moisture . Other then that rest facilities\rwere A class. Had paid buffet dinner after hot shower and buffet\rbreakfast next day morning was complimentary.\nAnyway, happy sort-of-anniversary! we were content from our trip\rwhich ended successfully. As of rain decided to return Bangalore before\revening so started at 10.00 am. On way this time we made sure to halt at\rWoody\u0026rsquo;s restaurant and had a quick stop at BANS for restroom.\rGod knows why people want to eat at Woody\u0026rsquo;s. It was buzzing with flies;\rI am sure if one or 2 fly get in with food I won\u0026rsquo;t be surprised so asked\rfor take away. Moreover we were so stuffed with buffet breakfast that we\rwere hardly hungry enough so had lassi only. And by 4.30 pm we reached\rour parking lot.\n","excerpt":"Ever since from childhood heard about Tirupati but never had a chance\rtill date or never understood why people use to grumble till they had\rdarshan.

The upper cup has two removable parts: a pierced\rpressing disc with a central stem handle, and a covering lid.The upper\rcup is loaded with fresh ground coffee mixed with chicory (~2\rtablespooons of mixture per serving). The grounds are gently\rcompressed with the stemmed disc into a uniform layer across the cup\u0026rsquo;s\rpierced bottom. With the press disc left in place, the upper cup is\rnested into the top of the tumbler and boiling water is poured inside.\rThe lid is placed on top, and the device is left to slowly drip the\rbrewed coffee into the bottom. The chicory sort of holds on to the hot\rwater a little longer, letting the water extract more flavor from the\rcoffee powder. This makes the decoction a lot stronger as compared the\rtypical western drip coffee, the decoction is so strong that you\u0026rsquo;d\rneed only 2-3 tea spoonfuls of it to flavor a 150ml milk. Where as the\rwestern drip coffee is quite watery to taste.\n COFFEE.SYS Not Found: User startup disabled. ~Author Unknown\n ","excerpt":"My addiction to coffee is old an old one.

There was lots of\rcrowds; it took us a while to get a decent place to sit and much longer\rto get our idli-sambar. We left for Yelagiri Hills and soon left NH7 for\rNH46 after first toll booth. There are signs for Chennai which you need\rto follow; continuing on NH7 will take you to Salem. So after driving\ranother 50 KM, we crossed another toll booth from where we left NH46 for\rYelagiri. This state road was not that great but OK. The last 14 KM is\ron the hilly section with hairpin turns. As we were quite early; not\rmuch traffic before or behind us. Plenty of monkeys along the road, they\rtarget cars for easy food if you are not careful.\nWe reached Yelagiri lake around 10-ish. Took a full round of the lake.\rWith Aarush we had no plan for hiking and boating so decided for lunch.\rIt was around 11:30 when we reached the Hotel Hills. The hotel was not\rready for lunch yet and Aarush had his lunch at reception while watching\rsome Tamil songs at the big screen.

We bought stroller one weekend and he\rstarted to enjoy a lot while going out. I used to even make him sit at\rtimes at home on the stroller when I have to do household chores and\rstuff.

It might sound weird but\rthat is true. Like yippee\u0026hellip; I did it. We had our first baby bath\rtogether, without anyone around. It was my first time ever to give our\rbaby a bath alone. Usually, me and my maid use to do it together. I use\rto prepare the bathroom, get warm water in his tub prepare the make up\rroom, his clothes. Then during bath time, my maid use to be in charge\rwith soaping and pat drying. Now, since we are of our own I didn\u0026rsquo;t want\rto have maid for Aarush till I am not going for job. So there were many\rfirst attempts.\nOn his eating habits once he mastered fruits I introduced him to cerlac\rand other new foods. As a first taste of solid food – puree of khichdi.\rAt first he didn\u0026rsquo;t liked much but slowly he started liking. Mashed\rpotatoes, carrots, beet, papaya and peas were given along with khichdi\rto him. This month we tried new recipe- ragi porridge as breakfast which\rhe liked \u0026hellip;not in first attempt ofcourse. Santanu sometimes use to feed\rhim before going to office.\nIt was quite harassing - and very tiring - to cope with the little\r\u0026lsquo;night owl\u0026rsquo;. He use to sleep right after dinner for hour or so and use\rto woke up as fresh as a daisy and be awake till 1AM in morning\rcompletely draining our energy. We visited doc and he suggested to keep\rthe lights subdued so that the baby\u0026rsquo;s sense of time is not disturbed and\rasked to follow a regular pattern. I use to massage him twice daily as\rmassaging might relax and it may be good as prelude to sleep through the\rnight. After massaging I use to feed him his dinner and then rock him to\rsleep with lights off. It worked that way. Certain days Santanu also use\rto put him to sleep which was a big help.\nI was asking for a mattress from quite a long so that I can put Aarush\rthere and can do household chores tension free. But it never happened\runless on one fine day he fall from bed while rolling. I told my hubby I\rknew, oh I certainly did knew all about this but\u0026hellip;Learnt a hard lesson\rthis month- never ever leave child unattended when once they are mobile.\rImmediately, got mattress that evening.\n","excerpt":"(17thJune - 16thJuly)\nAfter rice ceremony at Siliguri we finally came to Bangalore.

Our host\rmeticulously wrote down all the attractions near Madikeri. The list\rincluded Tala-Cauvery – birth place of river Kaveri, Raja seat,\rAbby Falls, Omkareshwara Temple, Cauvery- Nisargadhama. We\rdecided for all except the last one as we wanted to take it easy and not\rrushing between attractions.\nAs soon as we started driving to Madikeri (district headquarters of\rCoorg) the real beauty of Coorg started to unveil itself. The air\rwas clean - fresh but was bit chilled. The lush green hills with teak\rtrees and coffee plantation rejuvenated our eyes and mind. Coorg is in\ron the western ghat of India and above 1500 m. This makes this place\rcooler through out the year. Local call Madikeri the Scotland of the\reast (in North East Shillong is refereed as the Scotland of\rIndia).\nThere are numerous coffee plantation sizes various from few acres to\rhundreds. With coffee there are other plantation like orange, pepper and\rnutmeg in between. Almost every plantation has one or more streams for\rwater - all these streams joins Cauvery. as they descent. But currently\rthe biggest challenges are labor as traditional labors are migrating to\rurban areas for a better paying job and lifestyle.\n\nHeading towards Tala-Cauveri passed Madikeri, it reassembled like small\rhill town of North East with houses painted in bright colors perched on\rhill. This route leads to Mangalore. Being a weekday there were not\rmany cars towards Tala-Cauvery. Tala Cauvery is around 40 KM from\rMadikeri. On the way we took few stops to shoot pictures with clear blue\rsky. Only few days back, there was a\rMarathon(44KM)\rand road was marked with distances from the finish line. Last part of\rthe road was straight uphill climbs from Bhagamandala. Bhagamandala\ris supposed to be sangam of three rivers; Cauvery and the\rKanika are the real one, while third one is invisible (mythical).\rThere is a temple but we did not stopped and continued to final\rdestination through winding roads.\nThere is a pond which signify the origin of Cauvery. Its situated on\rslops of Brahmagiri hills. Every year during Makar Sankranti the\rpond over flows with water and devotees collect them as holy water.\rThere are\rsteps\rwhich takes you to the peak and gives a bird eye view of the temple and\rpond from there. I took Aarush in\rKangaroo-sling\rand he co-operated. It was very windy at the top which forced us to come\rdown quickly.\nOn\rthe way back, we had lunch at East End Hotel on the highway towards\rMysore next to petrol station. We ordered some rice and chicken\rcurry(kodava style). The ambiance is ordinary but crowded which means it\ris a popular destination and safe place for dining.\nAfter lunch we headed for Raja seat but somehow missed first time and\rhad to make an U-turn to comeback. Former kings watched the sunsets\rwith their loved one from this place. The curved road to Mangalore\runder the valley adds magnificantly with hills, green valleys, studded\rwith paddy fields in the background. There is a toy train which was not\rrunning at that hour for kids and family.\n\nFrom there we went to Omkareshwara Temple; this is within Madikeri\rtown. It was built by the Lingarajendra II in 1820 in the combination\rof Catholic, Keralite, Gothic and Islamic styles of Architecture. We\rcould not enter the temple as it was closed during the afternoon.\nAfter that we rushed to Abbey Falls this is going back towards Mysore\rroad and taking a left from the highway. In local language Abbey itself\rmeans falls so a literal translation will be falls falls. This road is\rwinding and narrow and we need to keep on driving as Sun was dipping\rquickly. This falls is located within a private property but open to\rpublic. Aarush too a quick short nap in this part. Soon roaring water\rwoke him up. It was a delight to find plenty of water during dry months\rof December. During the monsoon season from July to October it must be\rflowing like a torrent. The view from the hanging bridge is quite\renjoyable. The cascading water descends to the river Cauvery.\nHeaded\rback to home-stay before it was complete dark. Next day morning we were\rnot sure what to do (as Nagarhole and Dubare will not be\renjoyable for Aarush) and ultimately decided to head back to Bangalore.\rWe came back to Mysore spent a good amount around the main market area\rand Ramkrishna Mission. Around dusk we left Mysore so that we can reach\rBangalore bit late avoiding evening\u0026rsquo;s rush traffic.\nBottom line is you can visit Coorg all year around if you love rain or\raviod monsoon as it rains a lot in the western ghats. Getting out of\rBangalore is really difficult but leaving a place like this is very\rpainful after a nice trip.\nSome links\n www.coorgcreek.com coorg.com ","excerpt":"(\u0026hellip;.Continued\u0026hellip;)\rNext day we woke up leisurely had a wonderful breakfast .

Now last month\rwhile he was getting immunization after 15th months doctor suggested to\rvisit ENT specialist because of prolonged cough and speech delay. We\rtook appointment with ENT specialist at Manipal hospital and he gave him\rsome antibiotics. After two more visits he felt both his ears still have\rcongestion and things are not improving. The same line thought was\rshared by his pediatrics too so suggested for a microscopic operation.\nIt seems middle ear infection is quite common for children below 3\ryears. Read the same on\rWebMD\rif you are curious. There is a nice\rslideshow to\rexplain.\nFilled all the pre-approval hospitalization forms and again another set\rfor Insurance company. And ensured bed/room booking is all set before\rthe big day. Night before Aarush got admitted and we three spent the\rnight at hospital. Aarush was in very playful mood. Might be Aarush was\rthinking he has came to a hotel for a travel or so. Few doctors and\rnurses made visit and advised Aarush should be not given any food or\rdrink after midnight. He was scheduled to be operated in the morning\ritself. Around 10.30 PM nurse came to take his blood sample of about 3ml\rwhich was horrifying experience for all.\nIn the morning, he got his hospital dress and wrist band before moving\rto OT. He was in very cheerful mood as he couldnot make out what\ractually will happen next. While we were waiting just outside the OT we\rsaw 2 others little boys being treated on emergency. Pamela recognized\rKOUSIK - they were there with\rtheir son Iravan. We only know them virtually as we follow their blog\rfrom time to time. We were not in a mood to say \u0026lsquo;hello\u0026rsquo; for a quick\rintroduction. Wishing a quick recovery to Iravan.\nAarush operation finished within 45 mins. He was very cranky and cried a\rlot after returning from OT. IV fluid channel was setup in his right\rhand and he wanted to remove the same. After 30 mins or so we moved back\rto our special room. It is now almost 11 AM and still our litte one is\rwithout any food or drink for last 12 hours. After incessant crying he\rslept and woke up bit fresh around 12 noon. We gave him some Mosumbi\rjuice to start with. Around 1 afternoon he had his lunch and being\rfamished he finished his portion of hospital meal without any fuss. The\ramount of food supplied was enough for us and we also finished our\rlunch.\nAround 2 PM went to see his pediatrics and all seemed normal. But we\rwere still worried about cough and he said it will get better now and to\rrevisit him in a week.\nBack to room we are still waiting for the ENT specialist to visit so\rthat we can get a release note from hospital. The doctor was too busy\rand came around 4 PM and we were given green signal for release. Oh !\rwhat a relief\u0026hellip; that really is a big burden spending another night in\rhospital for no good reason.\nAfter good nap Aarush was playful, looks like he adjusted with that big\rneedle on his right hand quite well. As we are getting medical\rinsurance to cover this operation we could not be released before\rcompleting 24 hours which means we are hostage till 9PM.\nDinner for Aarush came around 7PM and this time he did all his routine\rwork for food which means it took an hour with lots of pleading, running\rbehind and cleaning the floor etc. At 9 PM paid my part of the payment and got the release order by 9:30 PM we were out of hospital.\nP.S.

Lots of magnificent stone show pieces were available which\rwere expensive for my budget.

But lots of bureaucratic paper work as all domestic gas\ragencies are controlled by government and it is a regulated market\rspace. From Bombay he came to Durg to take us to Siliguri.

They remind me of those\rchildhood days when they were part of our vacation (mass aviation is\rstill in infancy at India). They help to carry big over sized luggage\rthat Indian travelers travel with. As Indian travelers are not that\rphysically fit like westerners to lift their own luggage. Coolies are\rnot permanent employee of railways but have a long and strong working\rrelation with them. They get lots of benefits from railways like\rmedical, schooling for their kids and etc. Their recruitment process is\rvery complex and I am not an expert to write on details. What I know is\rtheir badges can be transferred between family members and the\rdefinition of family members is very vague.

After birth it\rwas third time when Aarush was taken out of the house to meet people\rother then his doc\u0026rsquo;s clinic. Moreover because of weather it was\rdifficult for us to go anywhere. Worst thing about his nanu\u0026rsquo;s place was\rsultry sun(temperature reaching 49 º C) because of which most of the\rtime he use to be in front of air cooler.\nOn other hand, its truly becoming irresistible for his dad I suppose. As\rhe came again to meet his son at April end - his heart was at Durg and\rmind at Mumbai.\nBy now our lil one was able to keep himself engaged by holding a rattle\rin his hand for quite some time. His maternal aunt along with two sissys\rcame to meet him. They were with us for a month. This month was full of\rentertainment for him with so many people to take care. His sissys were\rtoo excited to have him as their brother. They use to play a lot with\rhim even tell him stories while he use to listen very carefully without\rany noise – as if he understands everything.\n\nQuite often he use to cry in irregular pattern. At first, it made us\rdifficult to understand what actual problem is. Was it out of hunger or\rfeeling hot or some uneasiness. Every few hrs he will cry as he is\rhungry. Me and my parents were worried that he may be suffering from\rcolic, but then again, he slept well when it was time for him to sleep\rand played and laughed happily in excitement when he was being teased.\rHowever, when it was time for milk, he just refused to take in much,\roften taking only few ounces. Certain nights were really miserable as I\rhad to feed him after every 2hrs. Since I was with my parents it was of\rgreat help at these times. They use to take care of him while I use to\rcatch some sleep at day hours.\nIt seems this problem is common among babies at this stage, and whenever\rthey get hungry, they would drink. With Aarush, the slightest noise or\rmovement distraction would make him turn away in curiosity, no matter\rhow much I try putting back in his mouth. Now he drinks his milk\rwhenever he is hungry, not on any schedule.\n","excerpt":"(17th April - 16th May)\nNormally A is taken to doctor for monthly check-up once other then that\rno outing for him.

Lakidi is about 2 km south of Chain Tree and is the\rgateway of Wayanad which is on highway to Calicut. It is a ghat pass at\ran elevation of 700m above sea level.We crossed Kalpetta and drove\rmostly on NH 212.\n\nOverwhelmed with scenery as this highway is heaven on this earth , a\rbeautiful place with lot of tea gardens on the way. Its absolutely real\rpicture of natural beauty. This Tamarassery pass\u0026rsquo;s starting point is\rLakkidi which is one of the highest locations of Wayanad seems to be\rsecond in rainfall after Cherapunjee.\nHearing Lakidi view point I expected to be some hill view but this was\rin fact valley view with lofty mountain peaks, luxuriant vegetation and\rthe bird’s eye view of the deep valley with its winding roads. We wanted\rto get down the valley which goes to Kozhikode. By then Aarush was\rdeep in sleep with the motion of car so we took an oppotunity to go\rdown. It was really breath taking experience to drive on those winding\rroads with 9 sharp hairpin bands and after few more KMs we asked one\rlocal how far is Kozikhode - reply was 40 KMs. We could have gone to\rKozikode if there was no other binding or if we would have started early\rmorning. In our case, we did booking that morning before starting from\rhomestay to visit Vythri resort particularly restaurant for lunch-\rbuffet. And they are particular about timing from 1-3PM only. It was\ralready 1PM in watch so we decided to return.\nHere, we made one mistake I believe instead of visiting day one at\rtemple and Kurvadweep we could have gone to Calicut (Kozhikode) for one\rnight stay or just to see the sun set at Arabian sea. Anyways, there is\ralways next time.\nWhile returning saw chain tree just 2kms after ghat pass. There is a\rstory behind this tree. A tribal man showed a British this Tamarassery\rpass as a way to reach Mysore easily and British killed this man to get\rthe full credit. Then lots of accidents happened on that road and later\rone saint said the soul of the tribal man is responsible for these\raccidents. So the soul is now tied in that tree by a chain and then it\ris believed that the accidents are reduced.\nFrom here we visited Pookot lake. The lake is very calm and scenic,\rwas less crowded that day. Surrounded by hills and greenery. However,\rdidn\u0026rsquo;t do boating as said wanted to just relax. It is a natural fresh\rwater lake surrounded by evergreen forest. This lake is around 11 km\rfrom Kalpetta. It is basically meant for children’s pleasure.\n\nThen left for Vythiri resort. Its hidden among the hills. Roads are not\ryet tarred. Fifteen to twenty minutes drive through the tea gardens and\rforest may be a bit bumpy but they are very picturesque and worth going\rthere. Place untouched and not exploited by urbanization. This gorgeous\rplace has much to offer and you cannot be out of places to see here.\rSetting is a lovely-walk over the bamboo bridge to reach restaurant and\rthrough the plantation. We reached just at 3PM.\nFood was excellent; they had rasam as soup. 5-6 varieties of salad, 3\rkinds of cooked rice and long list of items like avial, erisery, thorans\r, varieties of fish curries and chicken. Last but not least 3-4\rvarieties of dessert too. We were truly up to throat. Relaxed there for\ra while. Wanted to take their 1 hour trail but because of dark we didn\u0026rsquo;t\rtook any risk and decided to return.\nWhat is Kerala without a ayurvedic oil massage? My caretaker\rarranged for one that evening. Oh !!! it was really very soothing felt\rlike going to sleep in no time. Thanks to Santanu for baby sitting\rAarush and he finished his dinner too by the time I was done.\n\nThis really was a home away from home. To relax totally and enjoy\rthoroughly, Wayanad has a salubrious climate. Thanx to Mrs.Sitha to\rmake us feel at home with her warm hospitality and smiling face which\rwill remain deep in our heart for long. She was always there for\rproviding us with all kind of comfort be it looking after Aarush or\rwashing his bottles or with boiled water. She is an excellent cook. We\rhad puttu, appam, puri, kerala parotha, kadi and many others at her\rplace. Mainly farm fresh and organic products are used for cooking. Now\rI really feel 3 nights are very less to experience all this.\n\nNext morning we started our journey back to Bangalore around 11 from\rthere. We had enough time to go to Edkaal caves and Soochipora\rfalls but we didn\u0026rsquo;t. One due to time crunch, secondly with Aarush we\rdidn\u0026rsquo;t wanted to climb up or down the stairs to view these places which\rwould have fatigued us. So without draining our stored energy much we\rdecided to return home. By 3PM we crossed Mysore;had Maddur vada\rand dosa on way to Bangalore.\n","excerpt":"On second day we went to see Lakidi view point, Phookot lake and\rVythiri resort.

What more parent wants if kid is happy\ryou are happy otherwise nothing on earth can make you happy.\nMorning, we were shown all rooms available there. It was a nice room\rwith a central common area and one room each on either side. Each room\rcan easily accommodate a family of 3 (2 adults, 1 kids)at main buiding\rwhile bamboo room can accommodate 4 in each room. We opted for room at\rmain building.\nThe huge banana and green paddy plantation in front of the home-stay is\ra wonderful delight to the eyes!! Then leisurely we freshened up and\rgobbled down the breakfast prepared. Her breakfast area is an open space\rwith neat dining set, covered by a thatched roof with lovely breeze and\rgreat view. Mean while Nash asked us what we wanted to do and suggested\rwhat we can. He gave all route directions. Truly, I didn\u0026rsquo;t wanted to do\rmuch but more of relaxing.\n\nWe decided to go to Thirunelly temple and Kuruvadweep.\rThirunelli temple is nestled amidst three hills. The deity worshiped\rhere is Lord Krishna, but the place gained popularity for the Papanasini\rriver (rather a stream flowing beside the temple). Road to the temple\rpasses via Mananthavady town from Panamaram is hilly with bumpy\rroads and green all around. You get to pass through fields and forest.\rPicturesque for sure. We drove the road which connects Wayand with\rCoorg and at the end we took a left turn(14 KM) for the temple. This\rtemple is a peaceful and serene place. Since not properly restored I\rwon\u0026rsquo;t recommend to visit. It can be skipped unless just want to drive\ror have some religious rites to perform.\nThen from there we went to Kuruvadweep. Roads didn\u0026rsquo;t improved much. As\rthe drive went on, different shades of green we could find all around\rWayanad. Nice treat to eyes; our eyes were relaxed seeing green all\raround. Since we stay in concrete jungle for us it was really paradise.\rThe water was knee deep, muddy and not very clean as there were plenty\rof plastics and junk from tourists and local shops - we did not felt\rlike crossing the same. If you have time you can take boat ride.\n\nAt evening owner, Mrs Seetha of the home-stay offered us with hot\rcoffee. Coffee and tea served are unlimited without charges and ensured\rthat we were served with hot sumptuous dinner once Aarush\u0026rsquo;s dinner was\rover.

For this I too was not getting\rsome time off from “Our little one”. There was absolute need of one\rbreak. Santanu suddenly said two days before last exam that he is having\rleave and if interested then we can go somewhere near by. Then he only\rstarted reading on net and ended up saying we would go to\rWAYANAD- Northern region of Kerala. Word\rof mouth were the major sources of procuring information for undertaking\rthe trip. Being at Bangalore, Wayanad was a good option since it was\ronly about a 275 KM drive away. Earlier he said he will go via\rNagarhole forest and return via Bandipur forest. My major\rconcern was about our stay. As with Aarush if we don\u0026rsquo;t look for proper\rplace then journey is not peaceful.\nWe looked for two homestays one near Nagarhole and other near\rSultan Bethary. Looking does not means that we will stay there but\rthen also we sincerely jotted them in MS- word with phone no. and all. I\rwanted to be sure where I am spending night otherwise I am not going\ranywhere. At that time he said we will do night stay at Mysore and then\rearly morning we will leave for Wayanad. So took down hotel contact\rdetails and address of frill-free\rGinger hotel of Mysore.\nSince that weekend was long weekend and Saturday was Santanu\u0026rsquo;s exam I\rwas not sure when exactly he wanted to leave from home. Because by the\rtime he will reach home after exam it would be late afternoon. Then also\ron Friday late evening we packed our things with \u0026lsquo;just in case thought.\u0026rsquo;\rOn Saturday he called me up around noon saying to call those home-stays\rif there is any availability or not and to be ready otherwise to leave\rimmediately within 1 hr. after he returns home. When I called those\rhome-stays only one was available. Gave a call directly to her for\ravailability otherwise pricing will vary then. Thereafter I remembered\rits not home-stays we are supposed to stay that night but frill free\rhotel of Mysore. Later after his exams I called him to clarify those\rdoubts and that time he said no we are going straight to one which is\ravailable at Wayanad. I was bit stupefied on hearing that - Was really\rnot sure whether he would be able to drive that evening or not but he\rsounded quite confirmed in his answer. Oh man! he is so adamant not to\rmake any proper itinerary before any trip.\n\nFinally, route was Bangalore - Mysore - Nanjangud - Gundalpet - Sultan\rBathery – Wayanad. We set off on Saturday at 4.10 PM from home and\rtouched Mysore by 7.15PM since it was already dark we missed the signal\rof Ooty and ended up going to Mysore palace. Luckily, from far we saw\rwhole palace being lighted up. So we made a halt to take photographs.\rSome open air music function was going on at eve of Ugadi. Around 7.50PM\rwe happened to ask one police-officer the route to Ooty and he was\rstartled seeing me and Aarush saying its too late to go there. Will take\raround 9-10 hrs to reach and road is not that excellent. And suggested\rto stay at some hotel at Mysore only. Then we said we actually want to\rgo to Wayanad. Hearing that he seemed to be quite relieved and said road\ris very good and gave direction to the same. By 8.05 we were in car and\rin no time were at route leading to Nanjangud. Our excitement was in the\rair.\n\nThe route to Wayanad had to be traversed through the hilly terrain\rhighway. We could not speed up much although Aarush was sleeping but\rdazzling lights from opposite direction vehicles were very disturbing.\rWe made few more stop - overs to confirm the route and then take-away\rdinner on route. Crossed dense jungle of Bandipur at night. We had to be\rvery vigilant through out. As this was our first night drive. There are\rlots of check posts and in one check post Santanu had to get down to\rgive driving license and car registration details.\nLady of home-stay – \u0026lsquo;Ente vedu\u0026rsquo; told\rme once you reach Sultan Bathry give call for further directions. Route\rto our home-stay was another 45 min. more from S.Bethary. We had to\rleave NH 212 and drive on a connecting road towards Mananthavady\rthis road was complete dark and up-down roads with lot of winding we\rwere not able to accelerate more. As it crosses villages there were no\rcar or person on the road. Still we found some night owl to confirm we\rare on the right direction or not. Her guide \u0026ldquo;Nash Jose\u0026rdquo; directed us\ralthough we were feeling quite uncomfortable for disturbing them that\rlate. Guidance was with location, buildings on the road sides and also\rwith distance from where we were calling. Later from one point we were\rnot able to figure out which route to take then he came himself to that\rpoint to guide us. Really nice of him. This home-stay is located in\rPanamaram, Wayanad.\nIn spite of reaching the homestay pretty late (past midnight) he showed\rus room and other facilities and bid goodnight. That night we were given\rone big room (kind of dormitory where many can stay together with\rbathroom but toilet was outside. Thank God we did not need to share with\ranybody.

How fresh I felt that\rday after bath and removal of all those bandages from lower abdomen.\nFor Aarush, his umbilical cord also fall off after 10days, he lost his\rweight in first 12 days. He got oral polio drops and one shot of\rBCG this month but didn’t cried almost – behaved very well with me\routside house and in front of doctor.\nAfter discharge from hospital it was tough to decide where to put our\rlittle one. Though Baby cots, cradles and moses baskets are widely\ravailable today, in India. But, I strongly felt breast-feeding would be\reasier if he sleeps with me as I won’t have to get out of bed every time\rto feed. So, weighing the pros and cons we made the decision together\rthat he will sleep with us. Till date he does sleep with us only. At\rnights when he use to cry on and off mainly being hungry or wet – we\rfelt our decision worked out best.\n\nWe truly spent hours staring at the little one cozily nested between us,\robserving his facial expressions while he snooze - particularly grinning\ror making crying face with his eyes closed and when he purses his lips\ris truly irresistible. At times we wondered was it a reality or dream -\rwith Aarush we’ve created a home nest that brought incredible joys and\rofcourse not to mention sleepless nights. As soon as he use to woke up\rhe would stretch a lot. His tiny hands use to remain tightly clenched\rwhile awake. In the form of short naps he use to sleep around 15-18 hrs.\rWhenever he was startled by a loud noise would thrust out his arms and\rlegs and drew back them or start crying. Yet, he couldn\u0026rsquo;t focus far off\robjects and that too small ones.\nMostly, my mom use to take care of Aarush be it potty cleaning, massage\ror giving bath. His thamma (my MIL) was anxious to try her hand seeing\rhis didu (my Mom) doing everything it was hard for her to resist. She\ralso got chance when didu was down with fever for 2-3 days. My dad and\rmother-in-law left after 15 days of his birth.\n\nAfter 15 days we appointed one maid who use to give him oil massage as\rwell bath and thereafter wrap him tight in cotton cloth just like a\rsmall parcel. Soon after he use to have his milk and fall asleep for\rhours.\nBy then, I became milk vending machine. Feeding every 2 -3 hrs was\rbit troublesome …it took me quite a while to adjust to the same. Often\rfor fun when I use to rub my finger to the corner of his mouth, he would\rimmediately turn towards it for sucking – my mom use to scold me a lot\rfor this action of mine.\nOn 21st Day we all went first to Kalibari at Vashi to offer puja (from\rthis day onwards me and Aarush were supposed to go anywhere). There\ralso he behaved very nicely and priest took him in his arms to give him\rblessings of Goddess Kali.\nFor Santanu, it was hard balancing work and home life.Along with me he\rwas learning to become fully trained, hands-on the nappy, changing,\rup-all-night which was definitely tiring. Big change over at work, Long\rcommute by locals - Obviously\u0026hellip; it was juggling act of enourmous\rproportions.

City traffic was not that bad on Sunday and further away it was\rthinner. After leaving behind the international airport there was not\rmuch of traffic at all and we really left the concrete jungle behind.\nSoon we crossed Devanhalli (new destination of real-estate agents) and\rroad towards Nandi-hills. The road from Devanhalli to Chikballapur is\runderconstruction which means sometime you get a proper highway or else\rDIVERSIONS with lots of big HUMPS. Those humps are actually meant for\rbig vehicles like trucks and buses while I punished my little Indica\rwith one or two whom I failed to recognize at right time.\nChikballapur looked like is small town as we passed by without stopping.\rFrom there the condition of the road improves except few patches where\rit is undergoing big construction.\nSoon we were greeted by a big sign board which read “Eenadu Pradesh\rwelcomes you”.\n\nJust after crossing the border we found RAXA Academy and AP Tourism\rRestaurant on our left. Right there we took narrow left turn and drove\rfor another 15 KM for Lepakshi. It is a state road that goes to Hindupur\rvia Lepaskhi. The road is narrow as well its condition is not very\rgreat. And as there is not much traffic we were able to drive in\rcomfortable speed as long as one is alert. There are few patches where\rwe found lush green paddy fields which soothes ones eye in scorching\rheat. We stopped by to take some pictures with sun-flower plantation; it\rlooked like an end of season for them.\n\nSoon we were able to see the back of big monolithic bull (Nandi). We\rreached temple in this heat around 1.40PM; and was relieved to be in\rshade. The temple is built by sandstone in **Vijayanagar (Hampi)**style\rof architecture. This is Veerabhadra temple where there is a big\rMonolithic Shiva-Linga. According to Hindu mythology, this seated\rNandi (bull) outside is gate keeper of Siva and Parvati generally faces\rthe main shrine. Here, it looks at this Linga (due to human settlements\rnow the line of sight is obstructed). We went into detail tour of the\rtemple as well courtyard. We almost burnt our feet while taking tour of\router enclosure.\nThe temple is divided into three parts - the Nritya (Ranga-Dance)\rMandapa, the Ardha (Worship) Mandapa and the Kalyana Mandapa with 38\rcarved unfinished monolithic pillars.The temple as a whole is built from\rsandstone and there are signs of severe erosion.

Aarush was brought to his crib next\rto me. His didu was first to hold him in her arms then was given\rforcefully to his thamma. She didn\u0026rsquo;t wanted to take him as it seems he\rwould become \u0026ldquo;Kol-lengra\u0026rdquo; (will get use to be in arms). His didu \u0026amp;\rnanu were extremely happy on his arrival as he was the first boy in\rtheir family of daughters and grand-daughters. My bottom part was still\rparalyzed. Since I was half conscious soon both new mom and son were\rsleeping. In the same evening, I was feeling sick while everyone in room\rlooked busy. Hubs busy seeing his offspring, taking picture running\rhere and there\u0026hellip;\rtaking all those phone calls,\rsms\n\u0026hellip; . I laid there looking around. My mom was there day and night at my\rside.\nI was to stay here for complete 5 days. During the stay in hospital, I\rwas asked not to take bath but only sponge for 10days from date of\rdelivery while an old attendant used to give bath to Aarush. She was a\rcharming lady always helping and giving tips to a first time mothers\rlike me.\nThe first two days was very difficult for me as I was not able to move\rmyself neither can sleep on sides because of IV and going out of bed was\rlike climbing Mt. Everest. On third day doctor removed the catheter and\rasked to go to loo by myself or with help. But at any cost I was asked\rto get out of bed which really killed me almost.\nWho on earth says its better to be operated. My personal thinking is\rboth normal delivery and c-section has their own plus-minus points. I\rheard and read from different blogs about normal delivery; labor pain is\rhell but the recovery is quite quick while in c-section birth is easy\rbut recovery is excessively painful and long. To get up from bed after\roperation I had to call attendant so that she would hold me and I can\rdrag along with her to the toilet, each steps felt like a mile. The\rtip is to start walking straight from that moment onwards however\rit pains you just need to do it. Although you feel a pull at the\rstitches but this is normal. Walk as frequently as possible even if it\ris just a few steps at a time. You will gradually find it easier to\rwalk.\n\nOn third day doctor asked me to start feeding Aarush; but it looked like\rI was not lactating so he was given formula through syringe. After\rtaking medicine I started lactating but he was not ready for\rbreast-feed. He did not like to work hard for sucking the milk while\rformula was dropped inside his mouth. He does not have to do any effort\rfor that. He really made me feel miserable because of sleepless night\rfrom that day. He was hungry but he did not wanted to take my milk and\rdoctor was now adamant on breast feeding only- “No more top milk and\rno water only breat milk till any solid is started”. On 4 th day\rsomehow he tried but very poor job. Being first timer I too never knew\rhow to feed. Result- got sore nipples. Then on 5th day pediatrics came\rto show the proper latch which really helped. And she added no cream for\rsore nipples- mothers own milk will heal it. The same evening I was\rdischarged from the hospital; we reached home just before dusk.\nBefore discharge I was given certain advice by my Gynae. to minimize\rpain and soreness as stitches are done in layers - No excercise at Gym\rfor next 6 months- walking is best excercise.No lifting of heavy things\rfor 2 months.Not to go near fire for 3 months.Resting helps to heal so\rdon\u0026rsquo;t even laundry,clean or do dusting for atleast first 2 months.\nAt home we were welcomed with blowing of conch shell and ululation.\rEverything went on smoothly till middle of night. Aarush\u0026rsquo;s crying\rsession started as out of habit he wanted top milk without effort. That\rnight was really long for whole family. Neither Santanu nor my parents\rhad sleep because of his crying. Whole night I kept trying to feed but\rin vain. Santanu and my mother were very anxious as yet Aarush did not\rstarted breast feeding.\nI experienced “A baby who has been crying for some time before being\rtried on the breast may refuse to take the breast even if he is\rfamished”. We made all the arrangement for the formula but we knew if\rwe give him top milk - it will be almost impossible to give up this\rhabit of top milk. Atlast, on Tuesday morning when Santanu was about to\rheat water to make formula around same time he started to have milk. Oh!\rGod what a relief that was for every one; soon both Mom and son were\rhaving a sound sleep after a grueling night. It took 6 days for both of\rus to learn the technique of feeding and to be fed.\n","excerpt":"Truly said-\nThe moment a child is born,the mother is also born.She never existed\rbefore.The woman existed, but the mother, never.A mother is something\rabsolutely new.\n~Rajneesh\nAs soon as I was moved out of O.T.

So at last, we opted for\rplanned c-section on 17th Jan.\nNight before took admission at MGM Belapur, Navi Mumbai.

Immediately my ob-gynae. was informed and I was prepared to be\rtaken to OT. Everyone was busy monitoring baby\u0026rsquo;s movement and heartbeat\revery few minutes as I laid on the bed. They wheeled me immediately to\rOT. Junior doctors, my gynecologist, anaesthesiologist, cardiologist –\rphysician and pediatrics were already there in the room. They were\rtalking among themselves as well to me to keep my mind diverted.\nThey moved me from trolley-bed to Operation table which was really\rnarrow . Ceiling suspension lights were turned on. On one side there was\rtable with their instruments and items such as pickups, scissors,\rscalpel blades and needles etc. Phew.. seeing them my heartbeat raced,\reyes rolled big. My gyne. was already ready in her surgical attire with\rgloves, caps, masks, suture sterile gown and protective eyewear. Soon my\rcardiologist along with anaesthesiologist went through the report and\rexplained what he is going to do, what would happen and how I will feel.\rVOILA! He made me sit straight and his juniors started preparing my\rback skin with antiseptic agents and there after he administered 2 or 3\rinjections at spinal cord. This was local anesthesia (partly\rconscious) compared to what I experienced before during 6th month which\rwas general one. While junior doctor helped me to lay on my back again.\rThese injections almost paralyzed me from bottom. As shadow less mobile\roperation light was switched on I surrendered myself to my doctor while\rshe comforted with nice pretty smile.\nAs I lie with my lower part paralyzed, hands strapped far apart. Once\rfinished with the catheter, I requested them to blindfold me as could\rnot take anymore of those sharp instruments coming that close to my\rbody. It took hardly few minutes (10-12 min.- I suppose) for my\rgynae. to take out the baby from womb. What I understood is stitching\ris long procedure compared to that of delivery part. “It’s a male”\rshe said barely discernible over the loud crying when someone spanked\rhis bottom. After delivering the baby she left the room while\rcardio-physician and anesthetist remain to do rest of their job.\rArrgh\u0026hellip; God the whole process went well. Around 12.40 PM Aarush was\rshowed to me\u0026hellip;he was so tiny then weighing 3.5kg only.

She says like\rbubbles or you\u0026rsquo;ll feel tiny flutters as your baby moves – I smiled and\rsaid yes.

I\rpreferred a week before Christmas to avoid traffic and tourist.\rInitial plan was to leave Bangalore on Sunday for Mysore and move\rfrom there depending on Aarush\u0026rsquo;s comfort. Stepping out of the home with\rhim means a disrupted routine and adapting to a new environment for all\rus. Somehow, I was super lazy on Sunday and postponed the travel for\rnext day. Even while dining on Sunday we were discussing just to be in\rBangalore for whole next week or not. Then I concluded the discussion by\rsaying- \u0026ldquo;we will start tomorrow(Monday) very early morning.\u0026quot;\n\nNext morning we could not start early either because of apathy; we\rstarted with normal daily practice and by the time we left home it was\r11:20 on the clock. Aarush dozed off as we crossed Bangalore city\rlimit and car picked some speed. He woke up when we reached almost\routskirts of Mysore. I was driving with comfort as it was 3rd time on\rthe same expressway in a short period of time. Followed sign for the\rMysore palace and reached south gate entrance.\n\nWe had our packed lunch in the car before entering the palace compound.\rBargained \u0026amp; hired a guide to show us the nooks and corner of the palace.\rCameras are strictly forbidden inside the palace and we also had to\rleave our shoes outside as we enter the palace. Without going into\rdetails the palace is awesome; well maintained in Indian standard but\rnot up to the mark like those of \u0026ldquo;Châteaux de Loire\u0026rdquo;. The work and\rcraftsmanship inside is too good which highlights how rich Maharajas of\rMysore were. They had natural resources at their disposal like Kolar\rgold mine, Ivory and varieties of expensive woods to fulfill\rtheir hearts wish. The campus also has 27 temples almost at every\rcorners of the compound.\nIt was dark when we left palace car parking and headed for a hotel.\rInitial choice was Ginger (new no frill hotel from Tata) as I did\rnot stopped on the way to note the phone number we opted for Hotel\rParadise. We were lost in dark while finding the hotel though we were\rcertain we are in the same neighborhood and then a lady Samaritan\rguided us to the same on her scooter. The room was nice and clean; it\rcost us about 2000 (san air conditioning) rupees. A old fashioned\rbeautiful hotel with nice view to whole city. The structure is old but\relegant. We discovered the well kept and manicured Hotel garden next day\rmorning.\nAfter whole days of activity Aarush went to sleep very early skipping\rhis normal dinner. Around 4 AM he woke up with full energy and\rstarted banging phone and other objects on which he could lay his hands.\rAfter one and half hours of playing he dozed off as the east sky was\rbright.\nWe woke up late; I called a friend at work who had been to Coorgweek\rbefore for details. After getting the contact called the same home-stay\rletting them know - we are coming today itself. This caught the owner\roff guard as he was not prepared for any visitor during the week but he\rsaid he will go to the market and dinner will be ready for us tonight.\n\nAfter breakfast we picked some necessary things before hitting the road\rfor Brindavan garden; it was already 11 AM. Brindhavan garden is\ronly 15 KM from Mysore but the condition of the road started to\rdeteriorate as we reached closer to the dam. It is just horrible with\rbig pot holes; big trucks carrying river stones are the culprit for the\rroad condition.\nBeing Tuesday, there was hardly any tourist in the garden. This garden\ris brain child of Sir Mirza Ismail influenced by Mughal design. The\rdam was built in 1927-32 by Wodeyar rulers of Mysore on river Cauvery.\rIn recent time, there have been renovation work going on to beautify the\rgarden and its surroundings. Old guest house have converted to Royal\rOrchid Hotel; kept wondering who goes there to stay on business or\rleisure. Only thing I could think off was to have corporate off-site\rmeeting there.\nAfter Brindhavan garden we headed towards Coorg via SH88.\n","excerpt":"Applied for a whole week off in December as I had 25+ days off to\rtake for year 2008 - this gave us 9 days off with two weekends.

This\ris considered as an auspicious sign.\n\nMom and mother-in-law of the prospective mother fill her lap,\rrepresented by the aanchal of her sari with items. Generally,\rmother-in-law will first bless with ululating the expectant mother as\rwell her unborn child and then put items like 7 different types of dry\rfruits, fresh fruits, sweets etc in the lap which will be followed by\rother invited married women. Had a wonderful time with all elders\rwishing me luck in their own way.\nLast but not least expected mother is fed well with seven different\rtypes of savory traditional dishes. A feast is prepared for the guests\ras well. In Bengali, no ceremony be it a wedding or baby shower is\rcomplete without elaborate serving rituals, but nowadays professional\rcatering or buffet-style dining is common. The courses progress from\rlighter to richer and heavier. Rice remains common throughout the\rmeal.\nStarting course is bitter a soupy mixture of vegetables in a\rginger-mustard sauce, called shukto. Followed by Dal lentil\rcurry - the most substantial course accompanied with fritters\r(bhaja). In fritters tailfin and head of fish is must to be\rserved to expected mother. The next course is two kinds of vegetable\rcurry which is followed by fish course of two varieties. Finally\rcomes the chutney course, which is typically tangy and sweet;\rusually made of mangoes or tomatoes or pineapple etc. And of course at\rlast sweet dish be it rice pudding (kheer) or rasogulla is\rserved which is not to be missed.\n","excerpt":"My\rbaby shower was done in the Bengali traditional way which is called as\rSaadh in Bengali. It is meant mostly to pamper the first-time mother\rto be and cheer her up as she accumulates courage to face the most\rtesting time in her life which will soon change her life in and out.\rNormally, held in the seventh or ninth month of pregnancy on a\rspecified day when mother-in-law will organize this ceremony.","ref":"https://santm.com/blog/2009-02-05-my-baby-shower/","title":"My baby shower"},{"body":"Remembering my journey to motherhood as Aarush turns one year old. After\r4 years of marriage and lot of traveling around Europe Santanu decided\rto move back to India to find a better professional career. Life as\rcouple was not full of hip and happening but we were happy and carefree\rabout the same. I use to scorn at people whenever brought up kids in\rtopic; balked at elders. After getting back to India this pressure was\rgetting on me. It seems no one bothered Santanu ever on this matter.\nWith time finally made a decision to walk on a family way after 3 and\rhalf years – although we knew it was not an easy journey but still.. At\rfirst we were completely ignorant on this matter. I did every such thing\rwhich one should not do; with the thought that when other pregnant women\rcan do job why can’t I? So got into locals, bus, trams, climbed flight\rof stairs, did moping ,brooming, cleaning, had papaya almost every day\rand what not. Result : on stepping in fourth month had unavoidable\rabortion.\nI took five months of rest before thinking on it again as per doctors\radvice. Somewhere I felt my biological clock was ticking fast. If not\rwrong, Santanu didn’t had any interest left on this matter; may be he\rwas scared to walk on this path again. With lots of discussion and\rdoctors second opinion finally for second time a life formed inside me.\rAlthough it was not “aha” moment as family faced untimely loss of\rSantanu’s father almost at same time.\nBefore conceiving only I was told by doctor that I have to be in bed\rrest completely (which I didn\u0026rsquo;t took much seriously at that time). Even\rwas asked to quit from job and stop doing any household work. It took me\ra while to find a helping hand who would take care of domestic chores.\rUnder medical ground I was not considered normal like 95% other women\rwhich was difficult for me to accept.\nThe journey started; everyday was full of anxiety and fear. Each time I\rprayed frantically for my kid’s safe arrival. At times, life was\rdifficult as well different and you never know how this journey will end\rup.\nCertain times I felt like entrapped with well wishers whom I wanted to\ravoid. Your very own people sometimes don’t allow you to be in peaceful\rmood. For some it was time to challenge me rather then giving me\rcourage. And there was no easy way out for me to escape from all this\rsituations. Everyone have their own say. For many it was time to make a\rbig speculation whether it will be a girl or boy….I really don’t\runderstand why people want to know when they have chosen to be a\rparent…after all how sex of kid matters.\nKeeping excitement alive amidst the stress of baby-making with\rweathering storms of weekly injections to preparing for the birth of my\rdreams was not at all easy. I was administered almost 40 injections\rin this whole 9 months journey. Along with whole cocktail of nutritious\rfood, medicines like folic acid, Susten, sujat, iron and calcium tablets\r– was to be taken regularly till end. Papaya and pineapple was big NO\rthis time.\nTo make things complicated Santanu had to travel for a month form work\rto Singapore. It was pretty scary at time, but looking back may be it\rhappened for good. The only time I was allowed to venture out of the\rfour walls was routine monthly check up with my gynecologist. Each time\rI used to find the streets had changed from the last time as some new\rshops, new pot holes and new buildings had come up.\nWith maturity of months I was asked to cut on salt, sugar, spice\rfrom my diet which was very difficult for foodie person like me. Not\ronly that beside house arrest bed rest was imposed on to me from 6th\rmonth after cs got stitched. It happened all of a sudden after\rsecond ultrasonography I was admitted on the very moment and had to\rspent 4 days in hospital. After getting discharged my life was even\rworse like a bird in a cage at times.\nI was only permitted to get out of bed for toilet and shower. My bed was\rinclined from leg side. Sleeping like a log on one side was really\rtough. People who have met me personally knew my condition. Before\rSantanu left for his office he use to keep laptop, books , phone on my\rside so that I can shuffle among them. It was a daily routine which went\ron till d-day. One doctor used to come each week to give injections.\nMy parents visited me for baby shower on the seventh month. On one hand,\reach time I felt movement in my belly, my heart use to fill with joy\rwith the very thought that soon I\u0026rsquo;ll hold my little girl or boy while on\rother hand I was not allowed to stand even in the balcony to get a\rglimpse of the out side world.\n\nIn the first week of January doctor removed the stitches and asked me to\rmove around in the house. It felt so awkward carrying extra weight and\rwas scared of doing something stupid at end of the journey. I was\rcounting every moment when finally we will meet. Taking advantage of\rdoctor\u0026rsquo;s permission, for first time I visited a baby shop to pick the\rbasic needful. At the end my doctor opted for a planned c-section as\rshe did not wanted to take any risk. And I was admitted a night in\radvance. I could not sleep much in anxiety and neither did any one who\rwere around me. My parents came a month before my delivery to help us.\nOn long awaited d-day when baby was taken out of my belly; someone\rslapped I suppose which was followed by high-pitched squeak and wailing\raround 12.07 PM looking as though the little one has just been in a\rfist-fight ( bluish, covered with blood and cream-cheesy glop) yeak\u0026hellip;..\nAfter a while, one nurse came to me saying “Pamela its male child”\rcarrying too delicate baby wrapped in green cloth with short neck,\rchubby cheeks, tiny curled fists, pink toes, quivering eyes, puckered\rlips and button nose.\n","excerpt":"Remembering my journey to motherhood as Aarush turns one year old.

Last month was quite hectic\ras we celebrated Aarush\u0026rsquo;s first birthday\nWe started planning from December onwards. As our schedule now revolves\raround his nap-time and whims we hardly get time for each other or to\rdiscuss any matter it’s just a lot more rare these days than it used to\rbe. So, gone are the days of last minute plan. Despite how he has\rcompletely turned our lives upside down we wanted to celebrate his first\rb\u0026rsquo;day which I know he hardly will acknowledge at this age. Basically, it\rwas more of a party for parents get-together on completing one-year\rmilestone.\nInitially,we wanted to have it in a restaurant with few friends and\rfamily members. Thus, short-listed few places but nothing was getting\rfinalized.We didn\u0026rsquo;t wanted dinner party as it could be more stressful\rwhole day for us as well Aarush might get cranky. We wanted him to be in\rgood spirits for the special day.Thinking on all this aspects, finally\rwe decided to have the party over lunch at our apartment club-house\rwhere we just need to rent some chairs and tables for that that day and\rthat is all.\nThis was the first time we were organizing B\u0026rsquo;day party we were not sure\rabout the logistical part. It took a while to come up with final plan\rwith inputs from veterans (in kids party).\nWe sent invitation to our guests through Evite in-order to get an\ridea how many guests are coming but we must admit we have to call people\rat the end except few. Most of Indian can not say \u0026ldquo;NO\u0026rdquo; so we have lots\rof guests in \u0026ldquo;undecided-mode\u0026rdquo;. That added one extra effort where we had\rto find out if they are coming or not from the \u0026ldquo;context\u0026rdquo; of conversation\ras no-one is going to say \u0026ldquo;NO\u0026rdquo; over phone either. This was truly\rdifficult part of all as based on this number everything depends be it\rfood ordering or cake or return gifts.\nThe food was ordered from Golkonda Chimney, near Marathalli. We were\rlucky to get hold of one event-manager who helped us in decorating\rthe place, getting music system, Bouncer, Caricaturist and Balloon\rModelling.\nDidn\u0026rsquo;t had any parents-child games as we didn\u0026rsquo;t wanted to worry too much\rabout entertaining the adults, just made sure they have all been\rintroduced to one another and they chat and mingle on their own.\nAs we already had cake before from Cake Walk, Indira Nagar - we knew\rabout its quality. Without thinking much we ordered 4 kg Black\rCurrent Cake from there after tasting a piece. Now all three of us got\rour Birthday cakes from same bakery after moving to Bangalore.\nNext tedious thing was to work out on return gift. We categorized kids\rinto 3 groups based on their age.We bought toys and books for around 25\rkids. Though it was not easy to choose from so many varieties -\rhopefully they liked it.\n\nOn the d-day party went on smoothly- Aarush was friendly. He was not at\rall cranky for a single moment seeing the crowd. We got some cute\rpictures\rthrough professional photographer, the cake was fantastic. Only thing\rwas we forgot to blow the candle before cutting cake.\nAt last we were very satisfied with the party and hope the same from our\rguests.\nWill always remember this first party of my son.\n","excerpt":"As usual there is lots of gaps of posting.

Nowadays he has developed\ra nasty habit of prolonged (around an hour or more) eating times be it\rbreakfast, lunch or dinner. After that he played for while but soon he\rwas sleepy for nap.

I beated\rpowdered sugar with melted butter first. In between I kept two eggs\routside of freeze to bring them to room temperature. Mixed one tea-\rspoon of leveled baking soda and baking power each in the flour and\rsieved 3-4 times to make sure there is enough air mixed in the flour.\rThen I whisked the eggs and added milk to it; after mashing banana in\rthe grinder I mixed all three together.\n\nNow kept adding half of the dry and liquid ingredients alternatively to\rthe sugar - butter mixture.

Sitting in Durg (center of\rIndia) was thinking what will be best way to reach Bangalore on Monday\rvia Mumbai. I have to reach Mumbai to pick my bare essential before\rheading south. And my flight from Durg was on Saturday noon.\nOn Friday night suddenly realized it would be great if I can travel in\rmy own car. This way I do not have to find a cheap air ticket and will\rhave no problem in commuting of my own @ Bangalore.\nThis will allow me to escape THE FAMOUS AUTO RICKSHAWS of Bangalore.\rThere are plenty of horror stories about them and you can always have a\rgood laugh about the way they refuse their passengers. They are very\rmystic in their behaviour, there are few honest hardworking but that\ronly proves Darwin\u0026rsquo;s rule– There are always an exception. Certainly,\rthis post is not about them .\nAfter lots of fanatic calls to friends and family members I was very\rfortunate to have Ramesh as my driver. He is a very experienced driver\rbut he does not drive any more. The plan was simple- To start early\rmorning for Bangalore on Sunday. We will stop as night falls and will\rreach Bangalore on Monday.\nI reached Navi-Mumbai around 9PM after spending afternoon and evening at\rsouth and central Mumbai. As soon as I reached home I had to complete a\rlong list of house-hold chores starting with laundry. As soon as the\rdrum started spinning I started collecting items those I will require\rduring my stay there. I picked items quite randomly but only thing I had\rin my mind was about a survival kit. After doing all that I tried to\rsleep at 2 in the morning but after a restless hour I got up and stared\rto wrap as many loose ends I could before leaving.\nHere is a chronicle of events that I had on that Sunday.\n\n06:00 Picked up Ramesh from Nerul\rRailway Station – Returned to Kharghar ; packed all items in the car.\n000 KM\n****\n06:45 Started from Home; the express\rwas well paved and it has concrete construction with numerous tunnels.\rThis is the pioneer road corridor which was constructed with divider and\rproper lane in India.\n041 KM 08:15 Started from Food Mall\r/Diesel stop around 40 minutes. There were lots of car, SUVs and buses\rpacked with families who were going out of Mumbai as schools were closed\rfor summer vacations. Hardly any room left for seating. Food was not\rgreat but every thing tastes good on road-trip when you have a hungry\rstomach and miles to go. The service was very prompt that really deserve\rappreciation.\n\n09:00 Pune We by-pass capital of\rMaratha culture; there were plenty of new big IT, BPO offices with glass\router wall but as they were spread on NH4 without any symmetry in\rbetween they were more of eye-sore rather than architectural beauty.\n09:40 We picked up a FM station from\rPune and it continued a long road. Very soon we reached another toll\rplaza and started our ascent for Satara Range. There are two separate\rroads for opposite direction. After lot of twist and turn you reach the\rpoint from where you get a great view. It was pity we could not stop to\renjoy the beauty from there.\n10:30 Road towards\rMahabaleshwar\n\n11:10 Crossing Satara which means a\rplace surrounded by seven (sat) hills (tara). One thing we had to pay\rextra attention was there are plenty of crossroads in the highway which\rallows people to take turn and cross the highway from other side.\rIdeally there should be flyover but as we pass rural area the extra cost\rmay not be justified yet due to thin traffic. But thankfully NHAI has\rput up fence to avoid crossing road everywhere. It is very common in\rIndia for cattle and human to cross road whenever and wherever they want\rwhich causes lots of accidents.\n12:00Crossing Karad, a small town\rbut quite good infrastructure with over bridges. At this point of time\rwe have crossed Krishna\rriver few times. The road divider were properly maintained with lot of\rBougainvillea planted. It gave a very good feeling on Indian road which\ris sometime synonyms with pot-holes.\n397KM 13:25 – 14:05 Stop for lunch\rnear Kolapur, Kolpar is the last major town in the Maharashtra side of\rNH4 and soon we will start crossing border of Karnataka. Lunch was a\rsimple vegetarian a quick one as we were not very certain how much road\rwe will be able to cover today - Bangalore lies in the southern part of\rKarnataka.\n14:43 We entered Karnataka it started\rto rain a little bit of drizzling around Belgaum. The soil color changed\rto red. Suddenly we found that we have to drive for almost 5 KM on the\rNH-4 north with opposing traffic as South bound was closed due to a big\rtrailer made a major accident.\n\n493 KM 15:17 almost halfway. There\rare some hamlets of houses which are painted by Airtel, TATA, Reliance\rfor their mobile phone advertisement or sometime it was cement and steel\rcompanies.\n15:49We cross a sign for Karwar\r(next to Goa going west) neat Dharwar but road was single lane. Saw a\rhorrible accident involving a TATA –indica and a truck and there was\rambulance. Hope the best for those in that car as it looked very\rterrible.\n\n560 KM 16:17 Back to divided road. We\rcrossed a huge Jain temple which from distance was looking like some\rspace station where rockets were ready for launching. After searching in\rinternet realized there are too many Jain pilgrimage palce in Karnataka\rwhich I did not knew.\n\n599 KM We were looking for fuel\rstation for last 15 minutes but there was none on our side of the road;\rfinally we found one and filled diesel ; we had fuel economy of 19.05\rKM/L with AC on the highway. We crossed one flight of stairs in the\rhighway but could not figure between ourselvs which will be nearest\rairport for this. Wanted to have tea-break but \u0026ldquo;miles to go before I\rsleep\u0026rdquo;\n636 KMAgain single lane, road\rcondition very bad, found almost finished yet un-finished flyover while\rwe maneuver the bad traffic- big trucks, SUVs just trying to cross\reveryone by hook or honk. This continued for a while we crossed a town\rcalled Ranibennur, it looked like Sunday was market-day as it was\rcrowded with village merchandise. There was police in the middle of the\rroad to manage traffic. The road condition did improve as we crossed\rHarihar at the sunset. It was very magnificent as Sun sets on the lush\rgreen paddy field on the banks of Tungabhadra river.\n\nIt became dark and Ramesh kept on driving. We decided to continue till\rwe felt like. Driving till Chitradurga our estimated destination was\raround 70 Kms away.\n765KM 20:30 We reached Chitradurga,\raccording to our destination; called relative in Bangalore and was told\rthe road should be better now and it might be a sensible to reach\rBangalore same night. We had a big dinner and stopped for one hour\rbefore we stared again. This really helped to stretch our strained body.\rIt seems there are road side hotels around 40 KM out of Bangalore A1(\rfrom Reliance group) and Kamat to choose from. The initial part of the\rroad was very bad and there were so many trucks. It was dusty and we had\rto be very careful with all these big vehicles; lots of them even do not\rhave rear light or brake light.\nAfter Dinner - I was feeling too\rsleepy and after all my best effort I dozed off for few minutes. I asked\rRamesh few times if he is OK to drive or is it better to park on side\rand take a small nap. As an excellent driver he kept on driving without\rany problem. Around Tumkur, we found hotel but as we were there they\rclosed as its mid-night and they closes at 23:30. So there was not much\rchoice for us other than to continue driving. Blackberry came very handy\ras I looked up phone number of my service apartment which was booked\rfrom Monday onwards. They gave their best direction but for us it really\rdid not mean much. There was one part of highway which was newly paved\rwith proper marking and division so a toll plaza followed.\nWe could not figure out much in the dark and kept on asking for MG road\ras direction whenever we found someone on the road. We met some stray\rdogs and one drunken group who were ready to start a fight as we opened\rour mouth in Hindi. Somehow we reached MG road and found English\rspeaking Auto-driver who gave us proper direction for the last mile\nIt was great to reach such a wonderful place. We found ourselves in two\rbedroom apartment; I took a quick shower before calling it a night.\nIn the morning we woke up quickly, dropped Ramesh to bus stop where I\rgot him ticket in Volvo for Mumbai. And I went to office – and thus\rlife in Bangalore started.\n\n Lesson learnt from this 1000KM trip\u0026mdash;Keep your wallet ready to pay the toll. In India, government is\rthe biggest “Bhaia” or “Don” they know all the tricks to tax their\rlaw-abiding citizen. When the road condition is good be prepared for\rtoll after every 40/60 KM. Keep change ready or you will get toffees\ras change in return. Not sure why NHAI kept those odd numbers like\r18, 23 or 22 instead rounding it to 20 or 25. Definitely there are\rlots to improve for NHAI if they want to put Indian road to world\rstandard. With highest rate of street accident and mortality Indian roads are\rnot ready for family travel yet. Initially, I was thinking to drive\rback to Mumbai one day but after seeing that accident and the bad\rstretch of 200KM before Chittradurg I do not think I will do that\rsoon. If you do want to drive; Drive during day and drive safely I\rmean very safe - HAPPY DRIVING\n ","excerpt":"View Larger\rMapA journey of 1000 KM from Mumbai to\rBangalore\nI was asked to reallocate to Bangalore in early May from my work; as\rusual had no plan till the last minute.

I am not a writer nor pose to have any writing skill but I like\rto read. It is said the type of books you read generally depends on your\rattitude and personality. I believe reading as a habit has always\rallowed to nurture a wholesome sense of well being. But most of us read\rbooks to lull ourselves to sleep.\nI read any thing that I can grab and not picky about subject or writer.\rOnce I like a new writer; try to read his other work as well. In last\r5-6 years can only think of two books that I started but couldn’t finish\r– ‘Satanic Verses’ and ’The Argumentative Indian’. This makes me\rwonder am I a good reader or not? Normally, I do not try to review books\ras I read for pleasure and have a good time. Though these books are well\rknown, well read and sold million of copies I wonder is it wrong with me\ror with these books?\nThe journey of reading book takes back to memory lane - we (me and my\rbrother) were hooked to reading from very early age as we grew reading\rbooks. Special thanks goes to my Mom for inculcating this habit in\rus. Switching from a totally pictured short comic to a immensely boring\rbook of at least a hundred pages, with no images or diagrams was not\reasy though so I don’t blame any kid who would frown at the idea.\nBut there were others too who really appreciated this habit of ours and\rgifted us wonderful books as we grew. We were considered as book worms;\rwe even saved money that we got from our elders to buy firecrackers at\rthe time of Diwali. As for us the philosophy was simple – book lasts\rlonger than a firecracker and you can always re-read books. We still\rhave those well preserved collections to re-read. Now a days, with too\rmuch stress in work place many of us miss out on reading in this very\rmanner and sadly it is only in times of grief, loneliness or insomnia\rthat we seek refuge in reading some stuff.\nI read many writings of Mr. Rushdie and really liked them a lot.\r‘Haroun and the Sea of Stories’ is my favorite; just found out it\rgot published after his most controversial work. I was in adolescent\rwhen ‘Satanic Verses’ got banned and always wanted to find out what was\rout there - a forbidden passion. So while in US I tried to borrow it\rtwice from public library - got bored and could not follow the story\rafter few chapters. I still wonder who are those who might have read,\rrealized the content before banning the book? Did they just ban the book\rbased on its name, who knows its a long history now.\nNow coming back to ‘The Argumentative Indian’, a collection of published\rworks by Mr. Sen during his long career and research. Though there are\rexcellent foot note and reference in page I could not agree with writer\rabout his view on recent India. Besides this, there were so many words\rwhich require frequent referring to a good English dictionary.\nMay be being a young Indian I see India from a different lens. Being in\rIndia I find his view on recent history of India to be unaccurate and\rone sided. To me his references are very academic in nature and away\rfrom ground reality; also his views are squinted for recent political\rhistory. Without doubt he poses to have vast knowledge about Indian\rhistory, culture and I am no one to make any comment on it.\nTo sum-up, this two books failed to keep me glued to finish it. May be\rone day I will try to finish them and will re-read… till then happy\rreading.\n","excerpt":"This question really sounds absurd to start a decent discussion on\rreading.

I was looking for an outing from a long time as\rcompletely burn-out with new and old responsibilities at personal and\rprofessional level. Spending weekends, doing absolutely nothing other\rthan sleeping and delaying all household work for next weekend. Made few\rphone calls here and there to old friends to know about their latest\rupdates.\nSameer told that they recently bought a small house in Nagaon near\r‘Alibag’ and he would be visiting soon and asked if I am interested to\rcome along or not. Without thinking twice I said OK that sounds like a\rplan. Alibag is in south of Mumbai; just across Mumbai harbor. Some\rsuper rich businessman takes their speed boat from Alibag to commute to\rMumbai. Spending weekend by beach front is very common gateway for\rMumbaikars and there lots of places like these to choose from. Have not\rvisited many ourselves in last one year as of expected parent we had to\rput a complete stop on traveling.\nThere was no such formal plan for Sunday but on Saturday evening came to\rknow that other two who were supposed to join can not make it. So it\rleft to two of us only. Sameer called me at 6AM informing he started\rfrom Thane and will be reaching Kharghar in next 50 minutes or so. It\rwas quite early for me but I was ready on time. We hit the road quite\rearly with the thought of going to Karnala first; do a quick hike before\rit is too hot.\n Crossing Panvel we stopped at Petrol Station to buy some water bottles\rand Sameer decided to fill car as well. But then there was glitch as\rthose guys in the Pump were unable to connect to Credit-card bank to\rswipe our cards and after trying for almost 20 minutes or so we\rdecided to pay by cash. Together we were only able to put 1167 Rs\rstill short of few rupees but they let us go. Now there was no ATM\rnearby and we had to cross a toll booth soon. To be safe we turned our\rcar for Panvel. By the time we found one ATM and reached the same\rpetrol pump again; we lost more than hour and had to cancel Karnala.\n The drive was pretty good and we reached Nagaon around 9:30. I was\rreading Sunday newspaper while Sameer watered all the new plants. We\rheaded for Kashid (30 KM south) beach.

We bought metro (u –\rBahn) day pass tickets before going to our pre-booked Novotel hotel.\nAfter taking our room key we left to meet Berliners, no longer East or\rWest Berliners but just Berliners.

If you don\u0026rsquo;t\rhave a lot of time to browse the whole store at least pay a visit to the\rtop floor which is Mecca for foodies. We also checked both BMW and\rMercedes showrooms where you find designer items other than car designed\rby those famous engineering and designer with perfections.\nWe walked to Berlin’s famous landmark Kaiser Wilhelm Gedächtniskirche\rrebuild itself but not at the cost of wiping its past. The ruins of\rKaiser Wilhelm memorial church stand as reminder of the suffering of the\rwar, right next to its hexagonal bell tower very much building of the\rpresent. The church is a reinforced concrete structure with blue-colored\rglass bricks while Memorial hall has still some of the mosaic decoration\rthat survived the bombing.\nFrom here we hopped onto double-decker bus line no 100 famous among\rtourists as it crosses most of historic Berlin.\n Tip: Sit at top as it\u0026rsquo;s easier to get a view of most top sights like\rReichstag, as well as the many other historic buildings on Unter den\rLinden.\n Got down at Alexanderplatz to see Berlin’s 365 metre high TV tower. Next\rto the TV tower is located the gothic Marienkirche, the second oldest\rchurch (built in late 13th century) of the historical centre of Berlin.\rIt is close to river spree and surrounded by few notable buildings with\rred-brick roof and right across the street was Starbucks – had coffee\rthere. I do not drink coffee but those chilly winds outside we took\rshelters few times where Santanu tried to give quick dégustation class\ron coffee. From here we walked to Berlin Cathedral built between 1895\rand 1905. We even climbed to the top of dome to take panoramic view. It\rfaces the Lustgarten (pleasure garden) and the Berliner Stadtschloss\r(berlin city palace). Lustgarten is a park on Museum Island. It houses\rAltes museum (old museum) which we visited later.\nIt was dusk when we were waiting in a long queue to visit Reichstag -\rGerman parliament near the Brandenburg gate building with large glass\rdome and access to top with a great view of Berlin. Although free\rentrance but extensive security check and at same time its worth\rvisiting.\nThen, we went to see Germany’s iconic landmark Brandenburg Gate at\rhistorical center and nucleus of former East Berlin district Mitte. This\ris where it’s all happening. It’s numéro one place to be seen and to\rsee. Cafes, bars restaurants, theatres, designer shops selling\reverything from shoes to scarves; day or night places along with many\rother sites of historic interest are teeming with people. It is new\rhangout for young and restless. In the very heart of Berlin is a\rmemorial to the murdered Jews of Europe which we didn’t visited as it\rwas already dark.\nLastly, went to house of world culture centre for non European art whose\rfloor was superbly decorated… no doubt.

That was\rbig fish as they served us; Pamela missed all those bones and head as\rthey took away that trolley (as she is a big human-cat who loves to chew\rbones be it fish or chicken). Well, slowly clock was ticking off giving\rus a reminder to say Ciao to Italy. Train to Paris came from Venice and\rwe had a good night sleep after a long strenuous day.\n Epilogue: Writing travelogue after 3 years was not easy. Had to\rrefer various web site to get the details right. But the only person\rmade it finish is Pamela as she wrote each\rpages and I just added few lines here and there. Yes, its worth\rremembering those eight days. This was great to immerse oneself with\rrecollections of those lazy afternoon or vigorous morning for sure as\rI know I am not going to have this kind of break soon in my present\rlife.\n ","excerpt":"Time to say Ciao, a presto (bye, see u soon) to Venice!!! Although\rwe knew it might never be soon again. With a happy mood, we left for\rMilan from where we started our memorable journey. We boarded Euro-star\rfor which we had to make an advance reservation. Indisputably it was the\rbest train we boarded in last seven days. On reaching Milan kept our\rluggage in lock room and set off to explore the business city as well\rfashion center of Italy.","ref":"https://santm.com/blog/2007-11-30-milan-shopping-trip-came-to-end/","title":"Milan shopping - trip came to end"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/venice/","title":"venice"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/lido/","title":"lido"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/piazza/","title":"piazza"},{"body":"Next day, when we woke up, were very happy to see blue sky after two\rdays of grey sky.

We went to Murano where one gets chance to watch\rVenetian glass blowers fashion their delicate objects known for\rglassware, lamps, chandeliers and glass jewelry. We started with glass\rmuseum and visited few glass factories, they show you the art, but for\rthem it is just part of work. We got few souvenirs for friends and\rfamily.\nAt evening we came back to Rialto Bridge. Rialto Bridge is famous\rfor its shops. There are three bridges joined together which makes it\rspecial. Wandered around saw many taking gondola ride – it’s\r‘expensive’. Best if you are a group of four to split the cost for\rthose twenty minutes. Any way, we could not found another couple to\rshare and decided against it. The route from the Rialto to the Academia\r(one of the famous museum) and back to piazza San Marco winds through\rornate squares and is quite interesting.\n TIPS: Get a travel pass to ride the elusive water bus – else\rsingle tickets are less economical if you plan to spend days touring\rin order to explore every nook and cranny. We missed few things at\rVenice; we did not visit the famous Opera house which underwent\rrenovation. We stayed in Lido but we did not explore its beaches. Last\rbut not least we missed to pick up those carnival masks for wall\rhanging.\n It seems Venice is not the place for pasta. Rather, Cichetti\r(chee-keht-tee) are small portions of food served in bars all over the\rcity, with small glass of wine. You eat while standing in a crowded\rroom. Certain bars display all the Cichetti before you; Sorry, couldn’t\renjoy that as I am not a wine-lover.\n","excerpt":"Next day, when we woke up, were very happy to see blue sky after two\rdays of grey sky.

We\rpacked and checked out, keeping our luggage in the hotel. We walked\rtowards Palazzo Vecchio (Piazza della Signoria) - city square\radorned with fine arts. Basically, Florence is full of timeless beauty\rwhich can keep you captivated. Close to this square is Uffizi which\rwe reached by 8:30 AM for our visit. Uffizi’s structure is like a long\rrectangle; it is not very big in structure like other top European\rmuseums. Famous paintings by Leonardo, Dante, Michelangelo \u0026amp; Boticelli\rare a sight not to be missed; a true Mecca for art lovers.\nAround mid-day we were back to hotel; picked our luggage and headed to\rtrain station for next destination – Venice. Venice is only three\rhours away from Florence by train. An unusual city built on small\rislands and traversed by some 100 criss-cross canals.\nReaching Venice first thing we bought 2 day-pass for Public Transport.\rDon’t be surprise the only way to transit in this man made city is by\rboat or water-taxi. We stayed at Lido across sea and there are\rplenty of ferries connecting St. Marco Square and Lido. On reaching\rhotel, to my surprise for the first time someone knew my birthplace as\rmentioned in passport. The manager on duty was a Bangladeshi who took\rrefuge in my home town during 1974 war. He is been leaving in this\rromantic capital for a long time. After a while we departed immediately\rtowards St. Mark’s Square which is quite lively with tourists\renjoying drinks and duel orchestra. It’s the place where you can notice\rincrease in level of tide water which shows sign of sinking Venice.\nVenice is the place where one can get lost in endless mazes of\rbackstreets, deserted squares and mysterious alleyways leading off from\rthe city. We walked carelessly around there and explored few narrow\rlanes near by.\nCost of dinner in the city of romance is very expensive if you are\rlooking for fresh local sea-food. We opted for a crowded simple\rpizzeria. Taste of the pizza was awful; disgusted with same as we were\rdiscussing between ourselves when a mother and her teenage daughter\rjoined from next table. They were from New Zealand on their winter\rvacation. It was a nice and long conversation with them as they were\rsupposed to go to Florence from Venice.\nWe took some night mode picture of empty St. Marco square with our new\rtripod before returning to Lido.\n With all said and done I found Venice like a big Disney land. There\rare only two kinds of people; either tourist or related to tourism.\rMay be there is a vibrant and young Venice somewhere which we missed\rto figure out. In Rome, Milan or Florence we never had the same\rexperience as there we saw local young people going to school or\rcollege or just hanging out in one of the piazza.\n ","excerpt":"After spending three nights in Florence it was time to move on.

There are lots of\rleather shops along Via di Citta (Main Street). Besides, there are\rnumerous other shops and restaurants lined against the narrow lane which\rwe found outrageously priced and too crowded with tourists. We walked\ralong that street and had mouth-watering pizza for lunch in one\rresturant.\nSiena’s cathedral is outstanding with black and white marble columns and\rdazzling mosaics on the floor. Do not miss the magnificent Bernini\rstatue of Mary Magdalene (does this bell a ring from Da Vinci’s\rCode?) hidden away in a niche of marble. Duomo is unfinished as you can\rsee the half constructed outer wall. inside every possible inch of wall,\rceiling and floor has been decorated.

We also had to take out light jackets as temperature dropped.\rThe hotel we stayed was not great but it was clean and functional in the\rcentre of city even we could see the dome of famous cathedral from our\rhotel room window.\nFlorence was capital of Italian Renaissance so planned to visit famous\rUffizi and Accademia dell’Arte. We started with the later one as\rit was next to our hotel. But we were surprised to find a long queue at\r8.00 AM. We had to use even umbrella in between but those rain did not\rdeter anyone in the queue as all were waiting with patience for their\rturn to enter.\nPhotography is completely prohibited inside; there are too many security\rpersonal who try their best to stop you as soon as you remove lens cap\roff your camera. Although flash photography is not allowed but still\rcameras flash and whispering sound you can hear. Some art students try\rto sketch at corners. He (David) looks really magnificent; recently\rcelebrated his 500th birthday. Besides him there are numerous other art\robjects to explore.\n TIP: Only if you are interested in visiting David and Slaves then\rmust otherwise there is no point to explore as not worth the entrance\rfee.\n We walked to Piazza del Duomo (Cathedral) after that. The cathedral\rof Florence needs lots of words to explain its beauty of architecture;\rmarble works on the wall and floor. You can spend days to gather details\rof those fine craftsmanship. The top of the cathedral (dumo) is really\rbig and it’s an engineering marvel when such huge dome was created\rwithout using any steel. The famous “last judgment” is there but\rlooking long at that one might hurt your neck. Outside in the corner\rthere is Battistero di San Giovanni which is considered oldest\rbuilding and in front there is “gate of paradise” which inspired\rRodin to create his “gate of hell”.\nNucleus of Florence is very animated and pedestrian friendly. Top\rattractions are minutes apart by walking. Piazza della Signoria\r(a.k.a. Palazzo Vecchio) is one of the main squares of Florence.\rOnce upon a time original David stood here along with other numerous\rsculptures before moving to his current home.\nWe decided to take Renaissance walk towards Ponte Vecchio through\rtown centre. On the way we bought advance ticket for Uffizi museum.\rPonte Vecchio is the oldest and most famous bridge over the Arno\rRiver; the only bridge to survive WW2 air bombing. This bridge is\rlined with jewelery shops connecting Uffizi to the old Medici palace.\nIt was time for lunch so we walked into a restaurant without thinking\rmuch and found it was white table clothed one. Surprisingly, the prices\rwere not enormous like other tourist places. We tried pasta which they\rserved with freshly baked bread; WOW I still lick my lip for.\nAfter that great meal we crossed Arno but we did not went to Piazzale\rMichelangelo or other attraction like Boboli Gardens from there\ryou get very good view of Florence but we skipped that.\nInstead we went to Church of Santa Croce; which have monumental\rtombs of Galileo, Michelangelo, Machiavelli, Dante, and many others.\rThough Duomo is not very far this is the every day church for locals.\rThere is a minimal fee to enter as tourists with free access to other\rparts inside the building. There is a leather factory run by the church\rwhere you get beautiful stuff without hassles of bargain. The inside\rgarden (cloister) is calm and lush green. Besides, this in surrounding\rareas they have lot of leather shop.\n Tip: good place to buy fashionable leather jacket.\n Took a bus to railway station to visit another famous church Santa\rMaria Novella, but we found it closed. This also contains numerous art\rworks. At last, at day end we went back to our hotel to freshen up and\rthen while we were looking for restaurants were greeted Buonasera!!!\rto one of true Italian restaurant. Here we had Tuscan speciality at one\rof the small, neat and hunted by locals. Worth saying gracias.\n Tip: It’s better to reserve in advance for museums (preferably by\rinternet to avoid long queue) although its bit costly but saves time.\rLouvre museum also have plenty of renaissance work so if you are from\rParis you can save money by visiting on months first Sundays (free\rentrance).\n ","excerpt":"Yesterday, late evening when we reached Florence it was drizzling and\rcontinued raining during the night.

According to our itinerary, distance\rto be covered was long one as our hotel was booked at Florence.\nWe took train to La Spezia, it was a crowded, got packed with each\rpassing stations of Cinque Terre but became empty as soon as we\rcrossed Riomaggiore. We had to wait a bit at La Spezia as train was\rcoming from north was late. We heard trains in Italy sometime get\rdelayed by few minutes to hours.\nOn our way to Florence we planned to visit the amazing 180 feet high\rLeaning Tower of Pisa - stop for taking pictures as we were crunched\rwith time for visiting top sights.\nAt Pisa, we left our luggage at locker room of railway station went to\r“Duomo” by local bus, which was a quick way to get a glimpse of this old\rcity. Pisa is also known for its famous university. As soon as we got\rdown from bus we found the entrance was packed with hawkers and souvenir\rshops. It is a pretty common site in Italy to find people from North\rAfrican countries trying to lure tourist with fake designer bags to\rsunglass.\nAfter years of restoration leaning tower of Pisa now allows visitors to\rclimb up 500 plus stairs to get a breath taking view and unique\rexperience. But there was a small catch – we were told to wait for next\rfive hours for our turn to come. With exhausted legs from yesterday’s\rhiking and dampened by the long queue we dropped the idea.\nIn the same campus there are three other key buildings which was also\rbuild around the same time. The bell tower only looks leaning once it is\rreferenced against it surrounding. We started with the cathedral\r(duomo) influenced by Byzantine architecture with magnificent red\rtiles on the top.\nAfter that we visited Baptistery- famous for its acoustics. And we\rwere very fortunate to witness the same. There was a group visiting the\rsame at the same time and one among them sang beautifully. Though we did\rnot understand any words what that gentleman was singing but we\rexperienced the power of music. It was a superb impromptu performance as\revery one inside stopped and made sure there was pin drop silence.\nFrom there we went Camposanto (cemetery) which are guarded together\rby wall called as Field of Miracles. As we have nothing much to do we\rtried plenty of pictures where we tried to give a push or hold the tower\nBack at station we picked luggage and boarded train to Florence. The\rview from the train was superb as we crossed the Arno River few\rtimes. The lush green of wheat fields with mountains at backdrop were\rvery scenic with sun setting in west.\nArno river is very famous river as it flows through the famous Tuscany\rregion. To some Arno divides Italy in north and south as there is vast\rpolitical and socio-economical difference in those two parts.\n TIP: European trains are very particular in time not fit for people\rfollowing Indian stretchable time. It’s always better to have some\rtime in hand as they close the doors of train 5 minutes before\rdeparture.\n ","excerpt":"Being exhausted from last evening we got up bit late and had very good\rbreakfast before hitting the road.

To get there, we have to cross the mountain\rto reach the western side of Italy. Need to change train at Genoa-\rknown for its pesto sauce and native place of Columbus. It is said that\ras the western side of the Liguria hills gets the best sun light\rwhich is perfect for tomato and basil. As we had to change train from\rmain line to local line we could only get glimpse from train.\nThere are special trains from Levanto to La Spezia which stops in\rthese five villages. As I write down about different trains lines I am\rsure you got an idea how remote these little villages are ; yes they are\rreally small villages. Tourist attraction has not yet turned them into\rmini town.\nCost of hotels in those five small villages were enormous so we booked\rhotel at Levanto, north of Cinqueterre a small village with sandy beach,\rbustling day-time markets. Later, while exchanging travel notes with\rfriends we found Levanto was a better choice in terms of food, spacious\rroom and most importantly price and service.\nAfter checking into the hotel in afternoon we rushed back to the\rrail-station to head towards the south most station Riomaggiore. We got\rone day “Cinque Terre Card” that allowed us to hike and ride public\rtransport in Cinqueterre. This small amount helps to maintain this\rNational Park.\nThe best way to explore Cinqueterre is to hike the trails between the 5\rvillages; there are other numerous trail which connects vineyards and\rsea. Of course, there are public transport or ferry to hop between\rvillages.\nWe planned to hike south to north in one go; the distance between\rRiomaggiore to Monterosso al Mare is 12kms, a lot of the\rtrail is steep and rocky. The hike started with steep stairs leading to\rfamous Via dell’Amore, (which needs no translation I hope - Path of\rlove). The walk from Riomaggiore to Manarola is the easiest which takes\rabout 15-20 minutes depending on how long you stop to gaze at the view!\rIt is paved all the way and fairly flat.\nThe next section of the walk is from Manarola to Corniglia ( 3km long\rand takes about 1 hour). Parts of this trail are pretty easy, but it is\rsteeper at times, the ground is sometimes uneven. The most exhausting\rpart of this section is at the end. As you arrive at Corniglia train\rstation there are also signs to reach secluded or public beach along the\rway. That means you need to hike down to the sea. The station is located\rby the sea side, while the town of Corniglia is on top of the hill which\ris connected by long flight of stairs!!!\nThe section between Corniglia and Vernazza is most scenic part passing\rthrough vineyards, fragrant herb bushes and rocky outcrops with\rspectacular views. It took about 1.5 hours to complete, though we\rstopped quite a bit to admire the views and took some breathe.\nToughest section is between Vernazza and Monterosso with lots of ups and\rdowns and steep stairs. It is a real bridle path which unwinds itself by\rthe seaside.\nFrom here, we returned back to Levanto by train full of sun-burned\rtourists.\n TIP: Need good pair of shoes to avoid weary legs and hiking pole\rwill save your knees. We hiked this part in late afternoon as we were\rcrunched with time but will advice to start in the morning so that you\rtake more frequent stops to admire the beauty and give rest to your\rlegs and lungs.\n At the end, we almost had to run as we were not prepared for hiking in\rdark and it was only us on that trail. You can spend few days in these\rvillages to unwind and explore churches and other historic buildings\rif those interest you. \u0026lt;/p\n ","excerpt":"We got up early had a quick breakfast and dragged our bags to Milan\rCentral Station; bought our ticket for next destination\r“Cinqueterre” - refers to five small villages (Corniglia,\rManarola, Monterosso al Mare, Riomaggiore and Vernazza) - cling to\rthe rugged mountains along Mediterranean coastline with breath taking\rview.\nThis UNSECO heritage site is not on the main train line or motor-way\rthat connects Milan to Rome.

Please hang\ron as we try to recite detailed vacation from our faithful memory.\nWe had a night train from Bercy Station, Paris. For us, reaching Bercy\rwas bit far from our Metro Station (Exelmans on M9) as there was no easy\rinterchange; while on street-road map it looks closer from our\rapartment. This train is not a fast train (TGV) but fast enough to take\ryou to Venice from Paris in one night. We started around 20:30 but due\rto summer it was still very bright day when we left Paris. We travelled\rby first class; the cabin was similar to AC 1st class compartment of\rIndian trains in size. No doubt, the spotless and punctual services are\rincomparable. Only down side of this night train is missing the beauty\rof Alps as we cross in the night.\n** Journey Begins:**\nAfter checking in pre-booked hotel at business centre of Italy,\rMilan and having our breakfast we left for Sforza Castle,\rrebuilt brick fortress and Parco Sempione. There is also “Arco\rdella Pace” resembling Arc-de-Triumph of Paris to hail Napoleon’s\rentry into Milan. These are in the northern part of Milan and worth\rvisiting.\nSantanu had heard a lot about Lake Como from his old colleague\rAntonio about his home town. Those countless description aroused a\rcuriosity to visit Lake Como. Como and other lakes of Northern Italy are\rvery famous as they border with southern part of Switzerland. They are\rthe tourist destination to relax in tranquillity for rich and famous.\rRich bankers, fashion designers or Hollywood movie stars all want to\rgrab a lake side property here. In old time, these lakes also meant\rreliable mode of transport to higher Alps from southern end.\nJust half an hour from noisy, bustling Milan, Lake Como is a magical\rcombination of lush Mediterranean foliage and snowy alpine peaks. We\rtook a classic lakeside promenade, where roads are narrow, bit\rcongested, and lined by old villas (some of which even converted into\rhotels) and from here we took a ferry ride to Bellagio on the\rsouthern shore known as the pearl of the lake.\nFerry ride is very enchanting leading to other small villages along\rlakeside which are hop away. Bellagio has narrow cobbled streets,\rbreathtaking views, impeccable small homes and glorious villas with\rwinding alleys, flowering balconies and lace-curtained windows which\rgive a feeling of most captivating spot.\n Tips: Instead of walking you can take a cab or bus from the train\rstation to the lake front if your legs feel weak.\n In recent time, two big ticket movies which I saw were shooted here -\r“STAR WAR –II” and “Ocean Twelve.”\nAlthough, village is not animated by tourists but still we repented to\rleave this place as we had already booked hotel at Milan. Train journey\rfrom Milan to Como was nice but lost in our memory to the natural beauty\rof the lake and that magical afternoon on ferry. On returning had dinner\rat one of the restaurant near Galleria Vittorio Emanuele which was\rscrumptious.\n Tips: As summer days are long, afternoon ferry ride is a better\roption that way you can use the first part for exploring something\relse. You may enjoy the afternoon sun on the ferry for a sun-tan. But\rtoo late in the afternoon means you might not be able to get an\r“aller-retour” ferry ride.\n ","excerpt":"** Prologue:**\nWeeklong journey of\rItaly takes us back\rto summer of 2004; due to various reasons never posted travelogues on\rtime though pictures from the same were published on time.

If craving for something sweet and sour at the\rsame time just have a bowl of creamy tomato soup to satisfy your desire\ras an appetizer.\n One kilo Tomato – boiled, peeled and deseeded. Two/three carrots – chopped to tiny pieces. One big Onion finely chopped Few cloves of garlic One red chili One Bay leaf ½ tsp cumin seeds Black pepper Nutmeg 2 tbsp Olive oil / ½ tbsp butter Juice from one fresh Orange Low fat cream or thick yoghurt Dried Basil / Parsley leaves - optional Salt to taste Heat the oil/ butter and fry cumin seeds, bay leaf, garlic and onion\rwith pinch of salt. When onion turns golden, add carrots and continue\rfrying at low flame. Once carrot is tender add tomato and fry for few\rminutes\nMake puree in a grinder (remove bay leaf before). Add water according to\rthickness required. Put the blended soup back in the pan. Bring to boil\rand cook for 5 minutes on medium heat. Now add freshly squeezed orange\rjuice and cream after removing from heat. Season it with nutmeg and\rfresh black pepper. Garnish with a couple of parsley or basil sprigs if\rany and serve hot with either croutons or bread slice.\nBest news is “Bread-Talk” boutique has recently opened at Vashi. It\ris a famous bakery chain from Singapore and they do cater good quality\rof various breads as well as desserts. But sadly, the dessert I got from\rthere was too creamy, spongy and sugary. I will say tasteless to my\rtaste buds as these kinds of pastries are very popular throughout India.\rAfter tasting European pastries, I find these one as - concept of\rwestern baked goods mixed with Asian ingenuity makes cool looking\rpastries that are hit-and-miss at certain point. While multi-cereal\rbread which I got was awesome.\n","excerpt":"Till far only soup ever tried to make was carrot soup in Paris that too\rin bleak winter.

Well, from\rhis conversation I figured out on other side will be another mid-life\rmiddle class male on the call. After few lines of small chit-chat the\rbig one comes (which inspired me to write this blog).\n“Oh he (some friend)! he is still in hospital on dialysis and doctor\rsays it will take another two weeks to recover.”\nOh God! that is alarming that friend can be just like me another middle\raged middle class. And now you read and hear everyday about people as\ryoung in twenties are getting heart attack. Well, no doubt life is\rstressful but we Indians make it even harder with our own karma, as we\rpoke our nose in every matter, as well in others matter; worrying about\rthem, giving constant stream of unsolicited advice is part of our\rnature.\n“Not sure what went wrong, Doctor says due to his high blood pressure\rhis kidney is not functioning properly. He is having heavy loss of\rprotein in the urine”\nIndeed too sad conversation, but then he admits \u0026ldquo;what more to say,\reven we do n\u0026rsquo;t know 2% of our body and how it works; we only go to\rhospital when sick”.\nNot sure how to say how true it is, in India there is no conception of\rprevention of diseases, people get really sick spends money (according\rto their capacity) as most don’t even have medical insurance and then\rone final day all is over. And worst of all, relatives, friends and\rbystanders never try to take precaution on the same for themselves as\rall think that it will not happen to them it only happens to others.\nNow the sunny side of the conversation.\n“I forgot to tell you, I got a Toyota Corolla recently; a good bargain\rfor a perfect second hand, you must come one weekend we will go for a\rlong drive to Pune.”\nIt is mandatory to announce, you got a good deal to show your acumen as\rbuyer.

If you think I am\rmaking it sound too boring, the reason is very simple as myself I\rhaven\u0026rsquo;t yet met a person like that.\nWell then the conversation continued with natural stuff like kid’s\reducation, stock market, weather and boss at work. By that time his stop\rwas coming so he cuts the call quite abruptly. For 90% Indians, phone\rattic does not require a formal hello or bye, conversation starts and\rends – cradles down – thats simple.\nMay be just like writing no concluding paragraph.

This is a big bliss as there is not much noise pollution, no\rmad driving and not much squeezing on road for space. They are quaint vehicles which are quite reasonable in price to\rhire, even if short on leg room, seat comfort, ceiling height, and\rwindow space. They also run in share mode, maximum of four person can share the\rride but routes are fixed for this kind. Mostly Mumbai-ans uses them\rto reach office from station or vice versa.

They run on CNG (that is the only reason taxi fair did not got a\rhike in last few years). Fixing the car is easy, not much electronic like new car. Each\rdriver knows his car’s technical fine points like his palm. Taxi drivers in Mumbai are still OK; not as honest like old times\rbut better off from their counterparts in any other major cities in\rIndia. Though there are new air conditioned taxi on the road which are yet to\rbecome mainstream. These will be air conditioned and fitted with GPS,\rcordless phones, electronic meters with printers.

As I go down the memory lane\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;year 2003,\rwithin 2 ½ months of marriage we have to move to Paris from US which was\ra big change for me. Apart from the cultural shock, language was immense\rbarrier for day today life as well to mingle up with people around. Not\ronly that, in Indian arrange marriage, it takes time to understand each\rother with each one\u0026rsquo;s weaknesses and failings. So, quite an adjustment\rin every way. Somehow, in milieu of all this I lost embedded stone from\rmy wedding ring given from Santanu’s family. Because of which I\rcouldn’t wear for long. And everyone use to consider me Mademoiselle\reven in presence of Santanu (thinking him to be mon ami) which I use\rto enjoy a lot.\nWell, it triggered Santanu and he asked me to wear something in\rreplacement but since I didn’t had any extra ornament with me that time\rI couldn’t. So, I asked him casually one day why don’t you gift me one\rdiamond ring which he accepted easily. Very surprising to me in\rcontrary to other married people (men) but I never took that very\rseriously. And it never came in our conversation. But somehow it got\rrooted in his sweet heart.\nIn our very first trip to Amsterdam he came up with this topic on\rdiamond ring seeing diamond shops around but somehow we could not\rmake-up our mind. And it became like “raat gayi baat gayi”.\n\nThen one fine morning while checking the accounts I found that some\rmoney has been withdrawn for buying rail ticket – bit surprising which I\rwas never told. I gave call to Santanu to figure out for which he\rhesitated at first. On repenting said “a wife should not be told about\rbank account no.” and said it was surprise to you for your b’day –\ra trip to Belgium.\nAnd at same evening after returning from his office he said to do\rresearch on Antwerp – for diamond. My GOD I was really taken a back for\ra minute that he took things so seriously. Thus, we planned for one\rnight, two day stay at Belgium.\nTrain ticket was too cheap; we left early morning train by Thalys -\rbullet train and on reaching Brussels checked-in our pre-booked hotel.\rAnd immediately after break-fast left for Antwerp which is a hour\rride by train. Antwerp’s diamond district is close to the Central\rStation. It’s said that Antwerp is famous for trading, cutting and\rpolishing diamonds. We strolled from store to store then finally decided\rto buy one.\nThen we walked towards down-town which was quite animated considered as\rheart of city. Grote Markt is beautifully surrounded by the Town Hall\rand decorative guild houses dating from the 16th and 17th century. In\rthe middle of the \u0026lsquo;Grote Markt\u0026rsquo; stands the Brabo fountain. One of\rthe most pleasant squares in the city as traffic has been banned in this\rpart. Being small place nothing much to explore. So, by evening we\rreturned to Brussels.\nOn reaching Brussels, we walked towards magnificent central square,\rGrand Palace which boasts the country\u0026rsquo;s finest baroque guildhalls,\rpopular pavement cafes and intimate restaurants. Hidden at the core of\rthe old town, it\u0026rsquo;s only revealed as you enter the narrow side alleys\rsurrounding the square. Had dinner in near-by Indian restaurant where\rfood was too blend to make locals happy.\nDay: 2\nNext day, we were ready to explore Brussels. So first went to\rAtomium which represents molecules with 9 atoms. This huge 9 balls\rare interconnected with escalators.\nTIP: Worth only if you want a panoramic view of Brussels.\nClose to it is Mini Europe with models of main highlights of all\rEuropean countries like Eiffel tower, acropolis etc which we skipped as\rwe already had a plan to explore other European countries during our\rstay at Paris.\nFrom here we went to Comic Strip Art museum which houses famous\rTintin and Smurfs where we spent quite a time as Santanu being one\rof the admirer of Tintin. Then we went towards Galeries St Hubert\rlined with cafes, theatres and luxury stores. It has gorgeous glass\rroofed arcade worth to see if only this is the first place of trip in\rEurope. Then we walked towards little boy peeing “Manneken Pis\u0026quot; -\rone of the Brussels landmark with different stories behind it. It seems\rit has around 800 costumes displayed at Brussels museum. Town hall\r(hotel de ville) was our next spot with needle-like crooked spire close\rto Grand place which is very vibrant.\nTIP: If you intend to do any other shopping remember Brussels is\rknown for lace boutiques and chocolates.\nFor us enough of shopping…now time to pack up. I wish there was some way\rto show my gratitude to my beloved hubby for this trip and expensive\rgift on PERFECT event which I cherish even after 4 years.\n","excerpt":"While categorizing our old travelogs I found there was no post on\rBelgium\rwhich values a lot for me.

Starting with Onam - the harvest festival of Kerala (the\rsouthern most state) where monsoon was first to arrive. Almost in same\rtime, in other parts of India month of Shravan is considered to be\rthe holiest month of the year which begins with festival of\rNaga-Panchami. When each Monday of this month, known as Shravana\rSomvar, is devoted to the worship of Shiva as this day is sacred to\rLord Shiva and is specially observed with austerity. Thus, it marks\rthe begin of festivals one after another.\nBasically, festival for Indians means its time to get new clothes, to\rget their house painted or everything else they asked for or thought of.\rTime for family get-together where numerous uncles, aunts and grandmas\rgrace their wishes with delight. It is also a time for homecoming for\rpeople staying away from the families. Their arrival multiples the joy\rof the festival several folds. Observing and following the festivals\rfrom childhood gets so much in blood that every Indian tries his best to\robserve the festival in customary way even if they are settled abroad.\rThus, passing it from generation to generation.\nPeople of all religions, castes and communities celebrate their festival\rwith equal joy and verve. Peculiarity of this land is where unity had\ralways coexisted with diversity, especially during festivals when people\rcome together to celebrate life’s unlimited joys.\nDespite rejoicing and gaiety, thanks to the string of festivals we\rcelebrate in name of numerous Gods and Goddesses other then those\ranniversaries (birthday-deathday) of great men of India.

So,\rthis recipe is actually initiated and arranged by my mom-in-law for\rhim while I prepared it under her guidance on our short stay at Siliguri\rthis year.\nIngredients:\n Sweet potatoes: 500 gms Flour: 1 ½ tablespoons if preparing stuffed one (otherwise 100gm for\rplain one) Milk: ½ litre Sugar: 1 tablespoon Coconut: ½ (grated) Cardamom (green): 2-3 Raisins Sugar: 1 cup Water: 1 cup Oil for frying Method:The Puli Dough:\nWash and boil the s.potatoes until soft. Peel and mash. Add the flour\rand knead into dough. Keep aside.\nThe Stuffing: (optional)\nBring the milk to a boil by adding a tablespoon of sugar in it. When the\rmilk starts to thicken, add the coconut and the raisins and condense it\rto a thick, sticky consistency. Remove from heat and add crushed\rcardamoms. Let it cool.\nThe Syrup:\nAdd a cup of sugar to a cup of water and bring this to a boil. The syrup\rshould be of medium consistency. Let it cool.\nMaking the pulis:\nTake a small portion of the dough in your hands and shape them\raccordingly unless it is stuffed. If preparing stuffed pulis then\rflatten the dough and make a cavity in the centre and fill it with a\rlittle of the above stuffing. Seal the edges of the dough and give it\rthe shape of a puli. Heat oil in a wok and deep fry the pulis in\rbatches. Remove from oil as pulis start browning or golden. And dip the\rpulis into the syrup carefully, one by one. Serve hot or cold.\nFrying Pullis: We prepared plain puli without stuffing but\rstuffed one are really mouth-watering and delicious….no doubt! Actually,\rRanga alur puli (fried sweet potato dessert) along with other pulis\rlike Muger puli (made of moong dal or yellow moong lentil), Chirer Puli\r(made of poha -beaten rice), chana dal puli, Chaler puli (made of rice)\ruse the harvest produce—rice, coconut, date palm juice and jaggery etc\rspeciality items of Shankranti.\n","excerpt":"Sweet potato dessert (Ranga Alur Puli) is an age old Bengali dessert - a\rsweet lover\u0026rsquo;s delight for sure.

Basically, an earthen pot containing a mixture of\rmilk, dry fruits, ghee is hung around 20-30 feet high in the air with\rthe help of a rope.

Thankfully, our local guy made a\rreservation otherwise we might had to wait in long queue.\nI started with some sea foods; I tried Oysterr for the first time.\rIt was OK but did not found the delicacy as it is said in France - a key\rcomponent of fruit-de-la-mer (fruits of the sea or sea food - in\rthis except shrimps and prawns rest all like oysters, clams, mussels,\rwhelks, and periwinkles come raw). If I am not wrong the concept is\rsame in Kerala (south-most state in India) where any fish is treated\ralmost the same. Being a Bong- I am a lover offresh river fish.\nIn the second round, I opted for Japanese sushi and sashimi which I\rlove and can have a lot. For many, it is raw fish (actually firm but\rmelt-in-your-mouth when you bite it). To me it tastes delicious when\rdipped in Shoyu (Soya sauce), speck of Wasabi (very strong, hot\rflavoured green mustard) and with gari (thin-sliced sweet pickeled\rginger). Ocassionally at end it is accompanied by sake-japanese\rliquor.\nWhile I was enjoying the same my colleague’s girlfriend had turtle\rskin soup.

Having my last portion\rof lunch I was searching desperately for something in my fridge but\ractually I forgot to buy one. My all time favourite item which I can\reven take truckload if needed in any form. It is generally considered to\rcool the body in tropical climates.\nI don’t know how and when exactly I developed taste for it. One of my\rfavourite childhood food item was a heaping spoonful of it. I’d lick it\rlike a lollipop until all traces of thick delectable were gone. As I got\rolder, I use to mix it with portion of vegetable curry(s) as well\rlentils given to me beside the last course. Now also I regularly indulge\rand make sure to have it at last after two main meals. Without that it’s\rsomething incomplete for me. I hope you guessed it by now… yes, I am\rtalking about yogurt known for its characteristic taste and\rconsistency.\nBeing born and brought up in cosmopolitan town had known taste of India\rfrom my childhood. Due to the employment opportunities created by the\rBhilai Steel Plant, people from all over the country flock here and the\rculture here provides a scintillating example of \u0026ldquo;Unity in\rDiversity\u0026rdquo;.\nWe had a south Indian neighbour when I was a child. I used to love\rauntie’s food over my mom despite she tried her best to make best food\rwhich I never appreciated. Like the proverb says “ghar ki murgi daal\rbarabar” (Self possessions are always undermined and other\u0026rsquo;s\rpossessions seem better). The memory still brings forth strong emotions\rwhen I think of it. I have one memory of eating this dish called\rCurd-rice as a small kid which Auntie used to prepare by mixing curd\rand rice with pinch of salt to taste if yogurt is bit tangy. For them it\ris common practice to finish any meal with curd rice. While our other\rneighbour was from North, so often used to have Raita - a special\rpreparation with yogurt; normally served chilled. Though there are lot\rof variation in raita of which boondi is most common. Vegetable Raita\rinvolves adding grated cucumber and mint paste or using tomato, cucumber\rand onion raitas or diced carrots. Sometimes tempering it with mustard\rseeds, cumin seeds, curry leaves, channa \u0026amp; urad daal with pinch of\rasafoetida. Actually, Raita is good foil for spicy North Indian dishes\rlike parathas, tandoori chicken, etc.\nNow being born in bongo family we have Misti doi a thick\rsweetened yogurt which taste as sweet as pudding which is served and\rsold in earthern pot. Presently staying in western part, Shrikhand\ris taken in form of dessert made from strained curd. A soft muslin cloth\ris tied up and hung to drain all the water for a few hours from the\rcurd. Sugar, salt, saffron, cardamom, diced fruit, raisins, and nuts are\rthen added for its taste.\nApart from all these, curd is widely prepared at home where it has an\rimportant place in traditional cuisine. It can be made from a small\ramount of store-bought, plain, freshly cultured yogurt by adding\rlukewarm milk thoroughly. The quality of curd depends on the starter\rused. The time taken to curdle varies with the seasons taking less than\r3 hours in hot weather and up to 10 hours in cold weather.\nDuring our stay at Europe I use to wonder seeing one complete row on\rumpteen varieties of yogurt from fat-free to bio-organic in super-store.\rNot only natural and unflavoured yogurt but also yogurt with fruit,\rvanilla, chocolate and various other flavours are common. To offset its\rnatural sourness, yogurt is often sold sweetened, flavoured, or in\rcontainers with fruit or fruit jam on the bottom. And when ever we\rtravelled different parts of Europe we found different texture and taste\rfor the same. It tastes completely different just across the border; in\r2003 European Union debated to give a standardized name to\ryoghurt, but later\rabandoned that project.\nWell well, wherever you go you will find curd; may be of different\rversion in terms of taste and characteristics. So, while I have my\rdaily dose of friendly bacteria you can certainly think on whether\rits worth to have or not.\n","excerpt":"It’s too hot and humid with power failure I was sweating like a hell.\rThough just few minutes before I took my shower.

And\rthey do pose what, why, when and where to quench their thirst.\nCuriosity starts with birth of a child and has no ends. The initial\rround of questions like does your child walks; has he started speaking,\rwhom does he resembles? As he/she grows a bit question changes its color\r– has he started going to school, then next question will be in a trice\rhow he is in studies; does he comes first in class (as if all parents\rwere merit holders). Apart from that of course there are questions\rrelated to his health, extra curricular activities which he has been\rthrown into.\nFew more years, child reaches his teenage where he is being again quized\rwith different set of questions how much percentage did he scored in\rhigh school and competitive exams; this is the most difficult phase as\rsome of those questions remains hunted in the young mind for rest of\rhis/her life.\nNow related to the “stream” he has opted for; child is categorized -\rif science particularly with maths then good considered having\rbright future in engineering if with bio then mediocre. Next in line\rcomes commerce, then with arts and last but not least home\rscience and others where student is considered good for nothing no\rmatter even if he has got gold medal.\nAs soon as he/she enters the new stage of his/her life next questions\rare already ready to be asked - does he have a job? If yes, where? If\rit’s abroad then– oh now you will have dollars /euros/pounds in your\rbank no matter if he/she is going to Timbuktu. What do you have to worry\rin life for? (as you have a kid abroad).

Bonafide operators ride black bikes with yellow\rmudguards and white number plate. These vehicles transport a single\rpillion rider. (Photo credit: from GoaBlog.org)\nAs usual after breakfast we headed towards Anjuna beach. Anjuna is\rgorgeous with its rocky shore and mighty cliffs where you can hear of\rtechno-thumping sounds and see hippies around. With morning sun and\rplenty of time at hand we made this special\rsign to\rremember Goa. Vagator, however, is the perfect hideaway spot with its\rfew beach shacks and fishing boats off in the distance. Black lava\rrocks, the coconut palms, the lush green landscape, nature playing its\rown music, and the sea turning from aquamarine to emerald green with\rChapora Fort at its background. The reminiscence of the old Portuguese\rtimes giving a splendid view of the sea and hills covered with coconut\rtrees and rice fields. To reach middle and little Vagator one needs to\rwalk but the calmness worth the effort as big Vagator gets bus loads of\rIndian whiskey drinking male tourist.\nAt noon, sun is really hard to tolerate but for lunch, we made sure to\rhave exotic flavour of the Goan dishes at whatever cost. So, we searched\rhard to find one place called “Gabriel” recommended by our guidebook\ras an authentic goan cooking. It was really worth searching.\nFor most Goans three basic necessities – fish, curry and rice. Goan\rvalues their food as much as they do their daily siesta. In their daily\rmeal, seafood always has a pride of place in some or other form. From\rfried fish to exotic concoctions; sea food is usually a must on the\rmenu, except for the occasional break for some religious observance.\rBesides fresh seafood, dried and salted fish dishes are also highly\rprized by Goans.\nWe ordered Galinha com Coentro (chicken with fresh coriander leaves\rand vinegar) and prawn curry with rice. It was really fresh, home –made\rand scrumptious. Owner was friendly; had chit-chat with him. We figured\rout it was guest-house cum restaurant with lots of shady trees around\rand not far from sea. Sitting arrangement is in the garden under trees\rwith fan. Since it was shady we spent 2 hours there and at last we were\roffered yummy chocolate (European one after a long time).\nIn the evening we prepared ourselves for soaking at Baga beach; smeared\rwell with body-oil. As on day two we found that sand was very fine and\rit gets stick to the body like glue even after proper shower. So,\rsmearing oneself helps as sand can’t stick to the body and washes off\rwith each roaring waves.\nAt evening we went to Tibetian market right across our resort where\rSantanu bought one finger-ring for himself and then headed for dinner at\rBaga-Calangute road to one nice restaurant. Wanted to taste one goan\rdessert for last 3 days; since we were not left with an inch place in\rstomach we could not but today made sure to eat less so that we can\rtaste it. For dessert best is “Infantaria\rPastelaria”\rrecommended again by our guidebook which was again right across our\rresort where we bought Bebinca – a layered pudding.\n","excerpt":"As we couldn’t enjoy much earlier day we decided to opt for rented bike\rand move around in our own pace.

It seems they are more appealing to Indian tourists\rwishing to combine peek at all top sights with the whistle-stop tour.\rSometimes they include certain places inland that you wouldn’t otherwise\rconsider visiting.\nAnywayz, Colva beach was not even attractive to us though it is an\roldest and largest fishing beach. There were international tourists\rmarinating in the sun and overcrowded domestic visitors paddling. Beach\rfront is dismal as stench of drying fish waft from near-by village.\nRiver cruise on Mandavi was one hour trip over crowed with mostly Indian\rtourists. Professional troupes perform the Dekni Temple Dance, the Fugdi\rDance and the Corredinho Dance with live music. You can shake your leg\rtoo as it will tempt you to dance to their beats.

May be they do\rit on purpose to make sure everyone is seated and not leaning on side of\rthe boat to take picture of golden ball as it goes down.\nOther then this they took us to souvenir shop (where they get\rcommission)- i.e., one souvenir at least visitor always carries home\rfrom his holidays in Goa are cashew nuts, spices and wine. Cashew trees\rabound the Goan hillsides. The flowering in January leads to luscious,\rbrilliantly coloured fruit in March, April and early May. It is then\rplucked, while the apple is used in the process of producing \u0026ldquo;Feni\u0026rdquo;\r(Goan speciality) and the nuts are roasted for consumption. Here locally\rproduced wines and beer are cheaper than anywhere in the country. Big\rpercentage of tourist to Goa are men from other parts of India who\rcome to Goa as an escape from moral confines of life at home.\nDisadvantage of this kind of package trips are they don’t give enough\rtime where they should actually give and secondly you cannot have taste\rof Goa or in other words you don’t have much choice for restaurants as\rthey take tourists to such a remote part where only one restaurant will\rbe there with awful food and you end up eating those as you don’t have\ralternative. In short, we are the people who want to explore more of the\rplace, know about the culture, food, enjoy the serenity, nature’s\rlandscape and all. So, this kind of packages are not meant for us.

We\ropted for South Goa to start with.\nLeft hotel around 9 at Indian Stretchable Time after breakfast in a\rnon-AC bus accompanied by one local guide. The itinerary included\rDona-Paula (bypass Miramar beach). Old Goa churches-Bom Jesus Basilica\rand se cathedral along with two temples Mangueshi and shantadurga\rdedicated to Shiva and shantadurga (goddess of Peace), visit to\rAncestral Goa/old Portuguese house and Colva beach.","ref":"https://santm.com/blog/2007-04-16-viva-goa-day-3/","title":"Viva Goa - Day 3"},{"body":"In Goa, traveling around by rented motorcycle or car is imperative\rif you want more than just sun, surf and sand. It gives lot of freedom\rbut can be perilous at same time. On second day early morning we haggled\rat least with three owners for renting and lastly ended up with Activa\rfor Rupees 250(it is better to rent for long durations to get good\rprice). Another reason for renting was we wanted to go to Bicholim to\rvisit Santanu’s maternal uncle for dinner. Normally, roads of Goa are as\rsmooth as airport tarmacs except few parts.\nAfter breakfast (bread, butter, jam and juice or tea) at hotel which was\rincluded in our package we rode on Calangute-Baga road and soon realised\rthat hotel in which we are staying is at main spot at entrance of this\rroad which leads to Baga beach.\nThis road to Baga Beach from Calangute is full of handcraft items,\rwhich are lucrative to foreign tourist (but not worth the money). Just\ropposite to our hotel was a nice Tibetan market which offers all kinds\rof gems and silverwork, wooden statues of the Buddha\u0026rsquo;s and Hindu\rdeities. Besides, Calangute and Baga have been swamped by Kashmiri\rtraders putting up Kashmiri carpets, wooden crafts, embroidery and\rpapier-mâché boxes for sale. Famous night clubs like Tito are on\rthis road - vivacious with tourist and locals that mean shops are open\rtill late while other parts of Goa goes to sleep.\nInteresting nugget of information about the Baga beach is that there are\ra lot of touts asking for para-sailing, water-sports, dolphin boat-ride,\rand banana ride etc. hawking wares include skirts, tee-shirts, novels\retc. You will be offered with cup of tea to ayurvedic massages as every\rone tries to sell their service or product. It means you can sip chilled\rbeer while getting a temporary tattoo done or reading a novel. For these\rservices you need to bargain -We were told they were offering good\rIndian price compared to foreign tourist .But in reality tourists are\rtourists and local try to milk them out as much they can - the bitter\rtruth of vacation.\nWell, we rented sun-beds at Rs 50 for few hrs took dip in the turquoise\rwater which was really fun. Best part to see majority of Indian women\rclad in colourful saris stand up to their waist in the water while\rothers wear shorts, bikinis and swimsuit. Pot-bellied Indian men in\rshorts or undergarments saving a buck or two for swimsuit. Though there\rare few smarties (women) who come prepared in Indian attire with\rswimsuit inside to take a dip and get quickly changed. Indian visitors\rflock to giggle at the tribes of dreadlocked white-skin on the vast\rwhite sandy beach.\nBeing famished we headed towards Plantain Leaf (only vegetarian) for\rudipi thali. Came back to hotel for afternoon siesta and left at evening\rfor Bicholim After tanking up at Mapusa we rode via Fort Corjuem to\rBicholim - it was a long ride but enjoyable.\n","excerpt":"In Goa, traveling around by rented motorcycle or car is imperative\rif you want more than just sun, surf and sand.

They never spent night at a female\rfriend\u0026rsquo;s place, especially if the friend had a brother no matter younger\ror elder.\nDialogues like “I am old enough to take care of myself” never worked\rwith my parents - you can say kind of very conservative upbringing in\rcertain matters. And it was normal for me to argue on all such matters\rthough consequences were known to me. So, out of anger I told my parents\r“you will never go to GOA without me or unless I go there first”.

But later came to\rknow from various sources that if one wants to enjoy beaches then need\rto make choice between north and south Goa beach. We opted for north Goa\rat last minute and booked with TICLO resort at Calangute.\nDifferent people had different views on Calangute which made us bit\rskeptical till last but I think we did made a right choice. Normally,\rhotels provide with “pick-up” service at Goa. On reaching Dabolim\rairport we realised our hotel haven’t sent any and they requested to use\r“Pre-paid service” which they will reimburse on reaching and they did\rstick to their words.\nAfter being ushered to our room which was quite spacious we left for\rexploring Calangute. We soon figured out that we were not very far from\rbeach so walked few meters along the beach at early evening then had\rpomfret and chicken in our dinner.\n","excerpt":"Trip to Goa was long due may-be you can say from 2001 when I got\ropportunity as a teacher with my school children.

It got its name\rsince it was on the old road to Bombay.\nNext day started return trip in the morning; we got to enjoy the whole\rjourney in those semi-comfy chairs of bus.

Our reporting\rtime was 00:15AM at Kharghar node but we were quite early then our\rreporting time 11:30 PM fearing we might not get a public transport to\rreach on time. We waited for our bus and waited, and waited and waited\rsome more. It was about 00:30AM and there was still no sign of our bus.\rWe gave a call to bus counter and asked them when the bus would show up.\rThe guy there kept on saying that it was late and it just started from\rother side of Mumbai-suburbs.\nIt was about 01:00 AM and yet no sign of our bus. All shops had closed\rdown and everybody else around us had boarded their respective buses and\rgone. And there we were, two sitting with bags on the pavement in the\rmiddle of the night. Phew! All along we were cursing ourselves and\rwas thinking the difficulties we might have to face if we have to return\rhome then at last at 1:30AM we did board the bus.\nWell, this time we even booked our hotel beforehand with MTDC. One\rcan check the availability; book the room of your choice from your own\rPC. The only trap is - pay heavy penalty if you change your mind at last\rmoment. We booked for Krishna cottage for 1450 Rs per night. MTDC is\rlocated near the road to Pratapgad outside of the city center, the\rdwelling units are covered in thick greenery. The stretch of road on\rwhich the MTDC lay is quite desolate. The PWD guest house is\radjacent to this resort, which is equally or rather more charming.\rTourists of MTDC can walk into the PWD\rguest\rhouse, stroll and even have food at the PWD restaurant. One more beauty\rabout the PWD bungalow is the sunset spot which we missed. The beautiful\rlawn in front of the PWD bungalow overlooks the whole ranges of\rSahyadri, more importantly, there is no crowd here. Really, much better\rthan Mahabaleshwar’s famous sunset spot. The lonely road is a good\rjoggers’ track or one can enjoy the walk (inside) which is pleasant or\rcan enjoy the backyard of cottage and you have an opportunity to listen\rto chirping of various kinds of birds. There are 30 cottages which is\rmost beautiful part of this resort. This resort is heaven for nature\rlovers as shrouded in greenery. A great escape for those assaulted daily\rwith the view of our urban jungles who really want to get stress relief.\rThe trees sway in the wind the swishing sound engulfs you and makes you\rfeel relaxed.\nSince, we reached early morning we had an option of choosing cottage of\rour choice. We picked lucky\r13\rclose to PWD guest house. The cottage rooms are quite spacious and have\rgood clean big bathrooms as well. The rooms are equipped with television\rwhich is only useful in case you plan on staying indoors.\nNot accustomed with nocturnal bus journey we were groggy. And moreover\rSantanu wanted to relax rather then rushing from one point to another.\rAfter having breakfast at PWD guest house we took a nap to recharge\rourselves. With nothing better to do we set off for Panchgani,\rPratapgarh and Wai at noon. Though Taxi wallah having fixed rate cards\rwe bargained for 1000Rs for 3 places.\nWe started with Panchmari which derives its name from five hills that\rsurrounds it. This trip includes Parsi\rpoint\rand\rtableland.\rParsi point is famous for best view of Krishna valley down below. And\rtable land offers the panoramic view of Panchgani itself. It\u0026rsquo;s largest\rplateau in Asia, a small plane can land here. It is situated 60 meters\rhigh on the eastern side of the town. It protects Panchgani from strong\rwinds, heavy rainfall and makes this hill station enjoyable all year\rround. It streches far beyond eye can see. On way we went to\rstrawberry garden where you can buy all the fresh products available\rthere. We bought strawberry jam.\nFrom here we went to Wai, foothills of Panchgani ancient town with\rtemples. It is believed Pandavas stayed here in disguise during their\rexile. Dolya Ganapati Temples on the bank of Krishna river are well\rpreserved of their times.\nAfter having late lunch we set off for\rPratapgarh\rwhich is about 26 kilometeres from Mahabaleshwar on the opposite side of\rour first two destinations. This is the fort where the legendary\rconfrontation between Shivaji and Afzal Khan took place and which saw\rShivaji emerge victorious. At pratapgarh we hired a govt. recognized\rguide Satish for 80/- who was very informative and helpful for taking\rour snaps:-).He explained every aspect of it in detail. The fort was\rquite fascinating and we climbed up some 400 odd steps to enjoy the view\rfrom atop. There is a splendid view of the lush green valley and the\rforts Raigad and Makarandgad can also be viewed on a clear day. We were\rnot lucky enough to have crystal clear weather rather it was hazy. On\rthe east and the south the hills have steep slopes covered with dense\rforest in contrast with rocky west and the north. The hills gradually\rdescend to the valleys separating Mahabaleshwar and Kineshwar range on\rthe east and the Konkan valley on the west. We enjoyed sunset on our way\rback to Mahabaleshwar from one of the Shayadri range.\nAt twilight, we headed towards our cottage. Suddenly there was a strike\rin the city and all the shops were closed. This situation caught every\rvisitor’s off-guard and everyone approached MTDC restaurant for dinner.\rThough tired and famished we had to wait for 2 hours - as small kitchen\rwas not capable to handle such big volumes of orders in one evening.\rWhat a chaos it was. Oh GOD!!!\n","excerpt":"Unlike last\rtime we\rbooked our trip with bus agency for 700Rs (2 persons).

At last, after longtime we took a day break on last weekend\rwhen Santanu came to know at last moment about his holiday on Maha\rShivratri. Since it was last moment plan we could only make for one\rnight stay.\nHarihareshwar is a small town with palm-lined beach known for pilgrimage\rcentre-Kalbhairav (Shiva) temple and its ideal beach resort of MTDC.\rThis beach is black due to the rock particles from rocky shores being\rmixed into the sand. The beauty of the place is its serenity (far off\rfrom city’s buzz) and lack of commercialization unlike other tourist\rspots Goa or Kovalam. Beach actually splits in two parts north and\rsouth.\nThe southern beach is where resort is located facing the sea which\roffers not only rooms but also tents and cottages in a bamboo grove with\rAC. But it needs booking well in advance. We repented for not making it\rbefore hand so we had to stay in “Geetanjali rest house” as paying guest\rin just 400 Rs a night. We had our lunch and dinner at MTDC canteen as\rthe view of the sea through the green is refreshing sight for mind and\rsoul. There are chairs placed under thatched roof where one can have\rmeal under a starlit sky with a sweeping view of the bay and some lit-up\rboats bobbing out on the sea. This side of beach is mostly deserted\rcompared to that of northern beach. Though our host asked us to have\rfood with them called as “gharguthis” with costal flavor ( Konkani\rmeals) – simple but hygienic at same time ; we denied politely as they\rwere having fast for Shivratri so we didn’t wanted to stress them.\nThe northern side is where temple is. It’s that side where one can see\rstunning sunset we lounge there to watch red ball taking a plunge in the\rblue roaring Arabian ocean. This roaring sound of restless waves dashing\ragainst the rocky shore is something to watch for hours. Its something\rcannot be explained in words.\nNext day we started early for Shrivardhan 15kms away which is famous for\rits beach, temple and historic monuments. Its home town and birth place\rof Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath (founder of peshwas) but beach is not\rthat attractive or well maintained compared to that of Harihareshwar.\n\nA lovely drive on NH-17 except bumpy roads starting from Mangaon to\rMhasla ahead past till junction where it splits into Srivardhan and\rHarihareshwar. Though it was a short stay but will last in memory for\rlong time. Moreover this was first time after coming to India Santanu\rdrove all the way 170 kms from Kharghar for 4 1/2 hrs at stretch. While\rcoming back we took halt en route near Mangaon to get some fresh veggies\rand brunch (Resort Open Umbrella).\nAt end Santanu regretted for not learning stick-shift before then we\rcould have explored France more.\n","excerpt":"After moving from Paris, we had been planning to take a trip somewhere\rout of Mumbai.

So first was to ask Pamela to come over at Fort area for\rlunch which was denied by her saying that lots of household chores left\rto be done. Then again I modified my plan and asked her to join at\revening for dinner when she told me she won’t as without any prior\rbooking no food will be available at any good restaurant because of that\rday- which is in fact quite true.\nDespite of her denial I didn’t left any hope I ended up saying we will\rgo somewhere outside for sure. With passage of time I got busier in work\rand stuck for long hrs. When I almost realized that there is no chance\rof dinner outside. But, somehow I finished my work by seven and left for\rhome. I reached home at half past nine when I was to take my shower and\rthen leave so another 30 min. gone. By the time we got into car it was\raround ten so on the way we decided to have our dinner at Bombay\rBlues, Center-One - Vashi. On reaching the restaurant the doorman said\rwith smile it will take 40 minutes minimum to get a seat. So, we took a\rstroll around other shops. Even after 40 min. there was no luck so we\rstood at door only waiting for our turn. After 11 we had luck to have\rour seat; now it was time to place order\u0026hellip;.. since it was enormously\rcrowded so one can guess quality of service and food to expect. Somehow\raround 11.40 got something on plate.\nI ordered for Chicken sizzler which looks awesome to hungry stomach\rbut awful to taste.

If there is any special occasion\rplanned for Wednesday evening it really cheers me up. On last Wednesday\rit just happened that Pamela called me at work saying that she is going\rto come to VT (CST) all by herself boarding a local train (…..for first\rtime).Thanks to Meher for encouraging Pamela to come over in the first\rplace.\nWell, Pamela did panic at last part of her journey as she was all alone\rin the wagon with two transsexuals sitting beside her. Moreover, on not\rseeing me at VT she vented her anger on me over phone as I was to meet\rher there. Its true, that I somehow always get entangled in work or some\rurgent phone call when ever I need to be on time to meet her. On top of\rit her phone battery was also running low. Somehow we did meet up\rwithout much problem and I am not that good writer to juice up that\rmeeting. Anywayz, as per plan we met Meher in front of GPO and headed to\rKala- Ghoda via Cab.\nKala-Ghoda is crescent shaped plaza nestled around an array of\rheritage buildings such as Elephantine College, the David Sassoon\rLibrary and the Watson Hotel. It is named after a statue which is long\rgone now of King Edward VII astride a black horse. This plaza is around\rSouth Mumbai which is fast emerging as the arts hub of downtown Bombay.\rMeher being born and brought up in south Mumbai she knows streets like\rback side of her palm. After walking across all those gorgeous office\rbuildings from bygone years we reached Horniman Circle Park where French\rrock band “Merzhin” was to perform for the Kala-Ghoda festival\rorganized by Alliance Française, Mumbai.. This festival actually\rtakes place inorder to improve the existing infrastructure of the area\rand giving it a distinct identity as Mumbai\u0026rsquo;s art district. And this\rfestival basically brings together work from various fields like arts,\rtheater, film, music, literature, dance, heritage walks, exhibitions,\rchildren\u0026rsquo;s events offering an interactive cultural mélange for\rMumbaites.\nAnyway, the introduction from the Director was very \u0026ldquo;French\u0026rdquo; as he\rmentioned if you want a good life learn French. What a snobbish French\rway of welcoming audience. Point to be shared is - a very different\rexperience as we enjoyed the concert sitting on chairs ;) \u0026hellip;hmm a rock\rconcert and sitting!!! The band was good and they tried their best to\rget people rocking but it did not work after all Indians\u0026hellip;.. that too\ron Wednesday evening.\nFrom there after an hour we left for dinner walking two blocks we found\rourself in front of Café Mocambo. It has two levels of seating.; the\rinterior is decent but not stunning. The menu is mostly continental and\rparsi with lots of Pasta dishes to choose from. Other then that lamb,\rsteak and lasagna are also available. They have standard fridge\rdisplaying yummy desserts - really yummy! Many phirangis also hang out\rhere.\n","excerpt":"From Sunday evening I keep waiting for middle of week i.e., Wednesday as\rnext weekend looks too far to me.

It seems Mumbai local\rtrains are the most efficient one carrying millions of people everyday.\rGetting in and out of local trains is one of the hardest tasks\rparticularly during rush hours which every mumbains has to undergo at\rleast ones in their life. So, lot of advice was given from Santanu’s\rmaternal family who are staying here for more than 15 years. Being given\rlot of advice the matter aroused curiosity within us.\nSo, on first day things seemed to be very easy unlike the situations\rwhich were being narrated to us. Even getting seats were not a problem\rneither getting down nor boarding was difficult. Thus our first trip by\rMumbai locals was quite easy and calm.\nBy the time we have already traveled twice or thrice for short distance\rin non rush hours. Now one day we decided to go to Mumbai central and\rparticularly towards south to meet one friend. But, that day our\rboarding station was quite crowded then ever experienced before. We\rmustered enough courage to board a train together which was again an\rexperience in itself. While waiting for our train, at platform we saw\rlots of women were waiting at one particular place which we soon\rrealized that this might be the spot where ladies compartment would be\rcoming.\nNormally, all seats are taken by burly or experienced people who time\rtheir jump onto moving train with perfection may be comparing them with\rurban cheetah will not be out of place. By the time train leaves\rplatform its overcrowded with half of people hanging towards outside\reither to get fresh air or are waiting for next station to arrive.\rHardly any place is there for a little fly to get in through the door.\nIn that crowd you can see people from different walks of life where some\rare reading newspaper or some are listening to music so loud as if he is\rplaying for his co-passengers or some are snoozing or some are staring\rwhile others maybe observing people like me. Even staring at women who\rhas dared to be there in general class is quite common as Mumbai locals\rdon’t believe in chivalry. Being only woman I looked around myself where\rI found few people are standing like fortress around me, while others\rstaring at me and when I look at those staring eyes I found many people\rpretending not to.\nSantanu is very possessive in certain matters by keeping his arms around\rme so that no one dares to say or touch trying to make a protecting\rshell. Somehow after a while we got some place to sit for few stops in\rthe mean time we learnt that if we have to get down at requisite station\rthen we have to leave our seat atleast two stations prior in order to\rprepare ourselves to get down.\n\nWhile sitting one experience many other things like depending on your\rheight one get following views - someone’s armpit across your nose; well\roiled hair poking right inside your nose; a newspaper across your face;\rpeople shouting over phone etc. That’s not last if you want you can look\routside even where you see many sitting beside railway track, brushing\rteeth, answering natures call and what not. Anyhow with the crowd we\rmanaged somehow to get off from the train without losing our handbag,\rsandals or any other personal belongings.\nIn Mumbai, there are three main train lines, with few junctions where\rpeople can change train. And there is no single station where all these\rthree lines connect each other. So getting in or out at any of these\rjunction station is really ultimate one…. rush squeezes to the limit\rwhich something I have never experienced before - its intimacy at its\rbest and privacy at its worst…. it’s co-passengers who will make you\rget off the train where you don’t need to put any effort to walk out.\rOne good push…and you find yourself at station and thanks to god that we\rfound ourself in one single piece and moreover with all our belongings\rintact and within seconds you realize that crowd which helped you in\rgetting off the train is already dispersed.\nAnd we took a long deep breath…..maybe something new to us but its just\rone more day for all other mumbaians. While walking past the platform I\rthought what about those disabled handicapped people, children, aged\rpeople, or pregnant ladies…..is there anything for them like in western\rcountries. In certain matters, India needs lot to do to improvise its\rcommuting system for every kind of its citizen.\n","excerpt":"After moving to Mumbai (India) commuting from one place to another was a\rbig problem (as we didn’t have our own vehicle). It seems Mumbai local\rtrains are the most efficient one carrying millions of people everyday.\rGetting in and out of local trains is one of the hardest tasks\rparticularly during rush hours which every mumbains has to undergo at\rleast ones in their life.

I do not know\rif my readers will be able to understand me. Moreover, my recent journey\ris an unusual one as most Indian travels east to west while I moved from\rwest to east.\nDuring my stay at Paris for last 3 and half years, most of my lunch at\rwork was at shared corporate cafeteria between three companies. I\rappreciated the price, quality of that food always particularly the\rdesserts and varieties of yogurts available there. May be I understand,\rwhy French cuisine is considered to be world’s most refined cuisine.\rUnfortunately, I am not a food critic that I can pen down those exotic\rtastes to get water in your mouth. But as I think about them I roll my\rtongue ;)\nIn general, breakfast in France is a small affair consisting of\rcroissants \u0026amp; bread rolls with some butter and jam to spread which is\rusually accompanied by milky coffee or hot chocolate or café noir. Since\rthere is no set time for breakfast in France it makes them bit hungry by\rnoon :) . Le déjeuner (lunch) was once a two hour mid-day meal but has\rrecently seen a trend toward the one hour lunch break.\nIt is common at corporate world to be given lunch vouchers as part of\rtheir employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants,\rsupermarkets and traiteurs; however people having lunch in this way\rtypically do not eat all three dishes of a traditional lunch due to\rprice and time considerations. A sandwich followed by a dessert is quite\rcommonly seen and can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets,\rcafes, bistros or restaurants. Even many restaurants, offer a lower\rpriced prix fixe menu at lunch which is not available in the evening.\n\n\n\nIt is common in France for someone wishing you “Bon Appetite” if he/she\rrealizes that you are going to have food as you take the exit from\roffice door or lift at noon while in India we hardly say anything before\rstarting our meal. Rather I believe there is no exact translation even\rin Anglo-Saxon culture for “Bon Appetite” but it does exist in Latin\rculture in some form or other like in Spanish or Italian lingo.\nI have been a silent participator for most of the times as I use to feel\rshy to communicate with my linguistic skill of French. These three\rpictures are the only I have from all those lunch time I had with my\rcolleagues. These were taken at very end of our stay with Pamela’s new\rphone camera. I always felt that I was going to miss those lunch hours\rif I move out of Paris; now I write about them before they become\rdistant memory.\nAt my current location in Bombay we do not have any in-house cafeteria\rat our office (a small office compared to Paris). There are plenty of\rrestaurants around to choose from or I can order for lunch at my desk.\rWith the last one you can work as you take a bite. I am sure any health\rfreak will tell that it is not good for soul and body. Food is supposed\rto be taken properly so that you chew and eat in peace while a meal in\rFrance is not simply a moment dedicated to the nourishment of the body;\rit is indeed a time for social and even spiritual replenishment.\nIn Modern India, where average work hours are getting longer and people\rare slogging more at work. This may be very disturbing social and\rphysiological changes and might have adverse effect as the dynamic\rworking population grow older.\n","excerpt":"I am finding it tricky as I try to compare my experiences and life\rstyles that I encountered from two different continents.

Its five days of festivity where this Puja symbolizes\rgood winning over evil. Maa Durga is considered as daughter of Bengalis.\rIt is believed that every year she comes to visit her father’s home\r(earth) for five days with her four children - Kartik, Ganesh, Saraswati\rand Lakshmi- representing respectively the Protector, the Initiator of\rthe puja, Knowledge and the Provider - signifies the complete\rmanifestation of the goddess. while her husband (lord Shiva) stays in\rKailash (heaven).This five days festivity actually starts from Mahalaya\rwith chant of Roopam dehi, dhanam dehi, yasho dehi (give me beauty,\rgive me wealth, give me fame\u0026hellip;)across Bengal. The festive mood builds\rup with rhythm of Dhakis (drummers)\nHer visits happened to be the best time for Bengali farmers. Weather is\rat best as the monsoon is just over and it is not yet winter. As there\ris no need for major work in the paddy fields everyone can be part of\rthis religious ceremony. Rice grows with the blue sky and little white\rclouds. Well, now a days this weather and farmer scenario does not have\rany true meaning for most of city dwellers. As it is either too hot\rwhich can be called as “October Summer” or raining heavily from late\rarrival of monsoon.\nNow a days it\u0026rsquo;s more of commercialization. Pre-Puja bargain sales and\rexhibitions introduce the sartorial style for the coming year. Bengali\rnewspapers and magazines publish special issues- platform for many\rbudding author, besides the works by well-known writers. Music companies\rhave a number of new discs and cassettes published in every Puja. Not\ronly that trains to tourists spots get reserved months before puja.\rBengalis in other cities in India visit their relatives in West Bengal.\rEven due to commercialisations decorations are very classy. There is big\rcompetition between associations who makes the best idol, best pandal\rdecorations etc.\nI remember going to Durga Puja on Weekends at San Francisco as every one\ris too busy with work during the week. So, Puja is held in weekend for\revery one\u0026rsquo;s convineance. And to add a pinch of salt – it is held in two\rdifferent weekends so that people can attend both the Puja celebration.\rWhile at Paris it was different as Puja is organized as per (tithi) date\rwhich sometimes made it difficult to attend.\nThe joke runs that if a couple of Bengalis get together, there will be\rsurely three Durga Pujas! Well, Bombay goes way past that quorum. More\rthen 22 Durga Pujas are held across the city. And here Bengalis\rcelebrate their favourite puja with same zeal as that of their\rcounterparts in Calcutta.\nBeing at Bombay, this year it was different after a long time as we\rcelebrated it with my maternal uncle’s family. There was one local Puja\rnext to our residence. We went at noon to offer (pushpanjali) obeisance.\rAnd once the offering to Goddess is over there is Prasad and bhog\rdistribution - khichudi (mixed dish of rice and (dal) lentils which is\rserved normally very hot (temperature) along with (baigun bhaja)\raubergine fry, (labra) mixed vegetable, chutney and (payesh) rice\rcaramel. There is a common ritual for Hindus offering and praying to God\ror Goddess in empty stomach. This created a bit of problem as hundreds\rof hungry people stands in queue to get prasad \u0026amp; bhog.\n\nIn the evening, normally there are cultural activities. Bengalis are\rknown for their eating habits especially snacks and sweets. Lots of\rfood stalls are set up near the pandal. Families will have their “Pet -\rPujo” (Stomach – Worship) so that their wife gets a day off from\rkitchen. I am sure this sort of events unfold every corner of the world\ras Bengali celebrates Durga Puja. Not only this but also people start\rthronging pandal after pandal. Road blocks are quite common. Children\rgetting lost are natural. Every bengali in their new dress, new shoes\rare quite commonly seen. As Durgotsav comes once a year – everyone wants\rit to make it as memorable as possible.\n\nThe special thing for this year was we enrolled ourself for visiting\rother Puja pandal in and around Bombay. The plan was there will be\rrented bus to take us to various corners of Bombay that way no need to\rdrive and no hassles of parking. And you can take a nap in between if\ryou can. Although trip was supposed to start at 10:30 PM and end by\rearly morning next day. But we started around midnight IST (Indian\rStretchable time) unfortunately that night it was raining heavily. By\rthe time we reached Shivaji Park we found it resembles a paddy field\rwith more then ankle deep water. But, we continued with umbrella and\rsocked shoes and sandals till next morning.\n\nBengalis are quite (un)famous with their obsession for caffeine and\rnicotine; each stop was delayed by few members for their tea \u0026amp; cigarette\rbreak. Thank-God all the food-stalls were closed due to rain and late\rnight other wise we had to wait longer.\nWith all these complaints it was a memorable night; hopefully we will\rnot repeat it again next year as it was fun for once. Surely we were\rtrashed next day and had lots of sleep to catch up.\n","excerpt":"Durga Puja is the most important and biggest festival in Bengal for any\rBengali Hindu.

It is great way to pass quality time with rain and\rheat where nothing interests me outdoor. I already finished few books in\rlast 3 weeks.\nStarting with, Dan Brown’s trash ‘Angel \u0026amp; Demon’ and ‘Digital\rFortress’. Well these are same old horrible as writing and story line\ris similar to “Da Vinci Code”. Well if you have read and liked it\rthen I am sorry to hurt your feelings ?. Reading those 3 books it seems\rMr. Brown wanted to cash quickly the old “James Bond” style. In each of\rhis book there is a very glamorous sexy female character in his book.\rThe less I write about this female character I do justice to them.\nA hollow story set in Europe which is a very far away country for his\rnative readers. Yes! To most Americans, Europe is so different - people\rspeak different languages as you cross few hundred miles and every\rthings change from food to culture and above all human features also\rchanges. It is not same as that of America where you cross 3 different\rtime zones and still have the same treatments. This way, when he puts\rhis characters and plots in twisted alleys of old cities of Europe every\rone takes them for real.\nHe really does not know nor do research for his subject matter and end\rup using\r“VLSI” and\r“PGP” in same breath in Digital\rFortress. Can someone please explain him what is super computer or\rparallel computing is ;) or rather how computer works has he been to any\rData-centers I have so many basic questions for him. I am sure the\rsimilar can be said about others related topic like when he drives car\rthrough Tuileries\rGarden\rfrom\rLouvre in\ra smart\rcar in\rDa Vinci Code which is set in Paris,\nWell enough of Dan Brown I am sure his book will loose their places in\rbook stores as readers figure out about them. It is possible in today’s\rliterary world to make some thing best seller in the same way Hollywood\rmakes “Charlie’s Angels” a hit with 17 screen writers and it is called –\r“Marketing”.\nThen I read two wonderful books one is ‘The Glass Palace’ by\rAmitav Ghosh about Indian subcontinent in early last century. This\ris a superb book and all the characters and the settings are excellent.\rThe time spans three generations in the vast continent from Ratnagiri in\rwestern coast of India to Malay. I found it very touchy; may be as my\rancestors were from a part of land which missed by mere 6 kilometers to\rbe included by in India by map-drawers.\nNow, since I know few occidental people who do not understand why an\rIndian Maharaja ordered ‘Cartier’ for a diamond necklace. The person\rasking the question was surely thinking these Indian feudal lords were\rjust sucking breads and butters of poor. For them this book might be an\reye opener as it portray Indian sub-continent as a land of opportunities\rand wealth. Though I am not a supporter of any Maharaja but I strongly\rbelieve the westerners did more worst things to whole world for their\rown profits. And even today they think and believe single mindedly\rWestern World is best but they miss the fine point that there was\rnothing before industrial revolutions in Europe.\nThe next book is “Wings of Fire” by “Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul\rKalam”. This book should not need any introductions but for those it\rsounds unknown- it is an Autobiography of India’s current President,\rfather of Indian rockets and missiles. I loved this book and felt dry\rthroats and wet eye as he along with others hundreds of Indian worked\rhard to give us the technologies and result which makes common Indians\rto be proud of their success. And best of all it is indigenous :D\nThere are so many parts of this book which I wish gets carried each day\rby common Indian like me and others to make INDIA proud. If religious\rand social harmony as we find in this book would have existed in today’s\rIndia we might have prospered more. As an engineer I do understand the\rbook is written by another person of same trade as it lacks wit and\rsharpness of successful memoir. There is mention of lots of\rabbreviations like PERT charts but for common people it does not make\rany sense. Similarly, there are some abbreviations which does not even\rbring any bell to me.\nIf this memoir is rewritten by a professional with all those beautiful\rpoems and wonderful events from APJA.Kalam’s own diary it can be Geeta\rfor modern India.\nWell other than these four books I read 2 more books by Chetan Bhagat;\rone about campus life in India’s most prestigious Engineering Institute\rIIT and other one on the life of young Indians as they work in nights\rfor the booming BPO or most commonly known as Call-Centers. Well both\rthe books are OK. I can not say them they are bad as they kept me glued\rtill last but failed to mark their place in my mind in long run when I\rwas finished with them. It is written in a modern way like Mira Nair\runfolds the story of Monsoon Wedding with hope that people other than\rIndian origin will also find it interesting.\n","excerpt":"Being in vacation and doing nothing much whole day I am left with lots\rof free time to read.

Like all\rother events in life this can be looked at like a coin; on one side the\rtravel time has reduced significantly while on other side only 20 to 30\rkilos of baggage allowed compared to California (65 Kilo).\nAs we were moving out of Paris we had lot of important things to bring\ralong with us that we will need till our shipment arrives in next 5\rweeks time. On the top of it, we added so many little things after the\rmovers left that I became jittery with two big bags,two big suitcases\rand one small cabin suitcase. Luckily as we are now member of Qatar\rAirways we got 15 kilos extra each so 90 kilos total.\n\nIt was very difficult to carry them from Apartment to Airport with 3\rnights stays at Cite universitaire campus as we handed over the keys on\r31st evening to our landlord. We had our flight on 2nd September and we\rwere left with 3 options- one to stay at friends place, second to book a\rhotel room \u0026amp; third to be at Maison de l’Inde in Cite universitaire at\rcheap price. We opted for 3rd option so that we don’t hassle anyone in\rthis procedure. Anyway, on our last evening at Paris we borrowed a\rbathroom scale from the reception to do a last minute check and we\rfigured out we are almost on the edge of 90 kilos. It made me really\rtensed and I was almost in need of counselor to release my anger,\rfrustration with bags, travel and move. From inside I inveighed against\rPamela for screwing up who was in-turn very cool as usual.\nIn a way, its good to drag such big luggage for last time to India. As\rthere we normally get porter if traveling by train and in flight they\rdon’t permit more then 15 kilos each.\nAnywayz, we dragged them from Cite University to RER station (600 meters\rapart) in the early Saturday morning. As we were huffing and puffing\rsome nice French gentlemen commented “Bon courage” (literally means\rgood- luck) – but it differs depending on the context like here good\rluck on dragging such jumbo size suitcases. To my utter surprise the RER\rride was very packed as I never saw so many people traveling early\rmorning to Parc des Exhibition that too Saturday morning. This park is\rthe last but one stop before on RER as we reach CDG-1.\nNow, as we had our flight from terminal-1 we need to take another 7-10\rminutes bus ride to the terminal. Which means one more round of dragging\rluggage from underground RER station to Bus stop and then arrange them\rinside bus as other passengers joins us.\nWell as we entered the check-in counter we found a long queue infront of\rus. There was big group who were coming from Paris to Tibet. With the\rthought of our baggage might cross the limit my pulse rate started\rincreasing and I made it clear to Pamela that I am not going to pay any\rextra euros per kilos at any cost. If needed we throw certain items in\rairport. Yes, with a very rough tone. That point of time I had no\rsentiments for her rather every simple words coming out of my mouth was\rfull of anger, anxiety and tension which I ultimately took out on her\runcontrollably. Weighed down by bulging bags made me tetchy.\nIn one little corner of my heart I wanted that she learns a lesson if\rbaggage’s exceed the limits though till far it never happened. Always\rshe makes it to the edge by stuffing so many things….but this time I was\rreally waiting to happen. Even seeing a long queue I started blaming her\rsaying that because of those heavy luggage we got late.\nWhile standing in the queue I tried once showing our membership card for\rcheck-in via business class counter but in vain… after some 15 minutes\rone gentleman came to us asking if we have membership card and we were\rlucky enough to check- in via business class counter.\nAfter checking passports \u0026amp; tickets she asked us in French:\nShe- vous avez combien de bagage ?(how many luggage you have)\nMe : Quatre (4)\nShe: Votre baggage s’il vous plait indicating it to place in their\rscale.\nAs I was placing luggage one by one with the thought now I will show\rPamela as soon as it exceeds the limit …..but to my utter surprise\rnothing as such happened rather lady at counter said – Est qu’il reste quelque chose encore (Is there anything\relse)with a smiling face.\nIsn’t it enough….Atlast, we were to weigh our cabin luggage which was\rbit overweigh by 2 kilos. But she accepted it without saying a word….bit\rsurprising you know otherwise normally they are very strict on that\rpart.\nBy the time Pamela asked her how much less it was from limit…and she\rreplied to it which I could not hear properly and it seem to me\rsomething like one kilo or so. Finally everything went on smoothly and\rshe gave us our boarding ticket with smiling face said Bon voyage.\nAs we were heading towards our gate…I was trying to show my caring\rgestures to Pamela which she shrugged off. Trying to make my point\rstronger I said- look, it was only one kilo less from the limit so what\rit would be if it was over-weigh. Now it was her turn to show me her\rrotten face for which I was bit taken a back first then asked her the\rreason for the same. Showing the baggage ticket she said it was not one\rbut onze kilo i.e., 11 kilos less from the limit.\n Well like always I apologized to her and this is a confession publicly\r:D\n ","excerpt":"I am not a person who hates flying to start with as my major air-travel\rin recent years was visiting India on holiday from Europe.

Well lots of questions and raising eye-brows from friends and\rfamilies.\nBut this post is not about why we left Paris and why moved to India. It\ris all about how we spent our last one week in Paris. Before leaving, we\rwanted to take pictures of those which makes Paris so desired\rdestination for tourists. No doubt it is one of the most visited place\rin the world be it for Eiffel Tower or Champs Elysees.\nAs our time for departure was coming close we tried to visit few of the\rwell known\rBrasseries\ror Bistros to hidden street corners to\rpassages\raway from busy tourist area. We did our best, but weather was not very\rhappy with our move and unexpectedly August was very grey with clouds\rand rain all those thirty-one days. It is a month when almost every\rthing stands still in Paris or France from bakery to fashion-store to\roffice- “tout le monde”. As every one heads towards sea “au bord de la\rmer” for getting “bronzee” sun bathing. If you come back from vacation\rwith out noticeable change in color your vacation is not well spent.\nNot only, we took lots of pictures and uploaded to our\rgallery but we reorganized them.\rIt was very long and meticulous process with thousands of pictures to\rsort and write their details as much as possible. In a way it was great\rto know more about Paris. All credit goes to Pamela for the same. With\rless than 16 hours to go before the movers were to arrive I rushed to\rLa Defense\rto take pictures, YES!! It was crazy but its worth for people like me (amateur\rphotographer) as it allowed me to capture those tall buildings with blue\rsky after washed by rain.\nAlthough, I am not sure if any one going to visit Paris is going to read\rthis post and check our pictures or not. But, somehow I got a feeling of\r“been there – did this…did that…” and I am very content from heart for\rthe same\nAs we spent our last two days in cleaning after the movers left before\rhanding over our apartment keys to our landlord. In this process with\rlots of small things to be done on other hand at last moment like\rclosing the bank account, getting official papers from office etc. we\rgot so tired and exhausted that we could not effort any long to run and\rtake pictures of “Parisians in roller blade”.\nThis post is getting bit longer than I thought so I will split the last\rfew days and hours in another one.

Having concave\rshapes they are one of the most useful shapes as they trap any sauce.\rTill far we have prepared-long pasta like spaghetti, spiral shaped\rfusilli, butterfly shaped farfalle, stuffed ravioli either with\rfresh crème sauce, tomato sauce or pesto sauce. Even we have tried flat\rpasta lasagna designed to be baked between layers of sauce.\nPasta is one of the staple food of\revery authentic Italian meal \u0026amp; most versatile food too. It is considered\rto be low-fat food and rich in complex carbohydrate. But, it is\rimportant to take care while choosing sauce as overloading it with\rcheese or cream sauce will change pasta into high-fat food and of course\rthe number one rule of great Italian cuisine is fresh is best.\nActually, prima facie on the colorful picture of the recipe in the book\ron Vegetarian by Nicolas\rGraimes, drew my attention and\rI thought why not to try it. Well, with out going to reveal the secret\rof this recipe here are the pictures as the cooking progressed. In other\rwords, let me try to limn an entire procedure through photos taken by\rme.

This is why French\rpeople visit the local \u0026ldquo;Boulangerie\u0026rdquo; (hot bread shop) at least once\ra day and this shop is there at least at every street corner. Filled\rwith delicious sensations and smells of warm, just-baked bread will\rdefinitely increase your appetite for sure while passing by these\rboulangeries particularly at morning and evening time. As this is the\rtime when fresh bread along with other baked items like croissant\rcomes out of the oven.\nWhile staying at Paris, I often see people riding bikes, mopeds or\rmotorbikes with baguettes strapped to the back, or walking the streets\rwith their baguette under their\rarm racing to get home at end of the day. So, it might be another reason\rfor thinking of baking bread at home.\nAnywayz, I wanted to get Santanu’s concern on this matter although\ranswer was known to me… “No way”. As he said “no” now I was bit\rdetermined to do it so was trying to gather all my courage to do the\rsame by myself when he is not around.\nFirst was to get ingredients particularly leavening agent such as yeast\rwhich I got it from nearby super store rest others are normally there at\rour Indian kitchen. As Santanu is bit health conscious so keeping that\rin mind I opted for wheat-flour which has superior nutritional value\rrather than plain all purpose flour and thought to encrust with either\rsesame or poppy seeds to give a special taste.\n\nWell, there is wide variety of breads and preferred varieties often vary\rfrom region to region especially at France. This variation is done by\rjust manipulating rising times, kneading techniques, and with the use of\respecially traditional brick ovens though basic ingredients like water,\rsalt, yeast and flour remains same. It can be served ranging from room\rtemperature to hot. But always best to have fresh. This can be used as\ran enclosure for sandwiches other then topping it with jam, butter or\rcheese. Even it can be served with pasta or as a complement to a crispy\rfresh salad or hearty bowl of soup. Once baked, bread can subsequently\rbe toasted. And its better not to be stored in fridge as it becomes\rstale rather one can store in zip-lock plastique so that there is no\rroom for air to get in.\nHere, I used very simple technique as this was my first experiment on\rbread and voila unexpectedly my experiment came out quite well then I\rthought. Even Santanu was astonished to see that.\nOnce you have tasted the fresh bread either from boulangerie or\rhome-made I am sure you will never forget its taste. A crisp, crunchy\rcrust and slightly chewy, soft spongy center make this bread bit\rtraditional.\n","excerpt":"For quite a long was thinking to prepare bread at home which I would\rhave never thought of in my wildest dream if I was in India.

He rather mentioned it appeared to be nice\rdown at the bottom of the mountain, nothing was promised way up top.\rSince, the journey to Interlaken takes around 3 hours by train so we\rleft Zurich around 7AM leaving our host still sleeping.\n\nAnywayz, at Interlaken we already had a booking for an apartment hotel\rwhich was cheap, cozy with all kitchen amenities in the room; that means\rwe can cook our own food if we want. So, we first went to our\rapartment-hotel to keep our luggage .Then headed to Mount Jungfrau- top\rof Europe.\nIn Switzerland prices are always astronomical so ticket to Jungfrau was\rno exception. Like always we carried “take-away” lunch before boarding\rthe train. After reaching Lauterbrunnen from Interlaken we were to\rchange and take cog-wheel train to reach to Kleine-Scheidegg a tiny,\risolated resort surrounded by vertiginous scenery. In a short time, as\rwe ascended, the villages below were barely visible. The presence of\rsnow gradually increased, while the temperature gradually decreased.\nFrom Kleine-Scheidegg we changed to the Jungfraubahn, another train,\rwhich tunnels straight into the rock of the Eiger. Stopping briefly for\rpanoramic picture; looking at glacier from a rock window to say in\rsimple words. This ride up is by world\u0026rsquo;s longest existing cog-rail and\rquite extraordinary. I assume it is among the most fascinating scenery\rin the world we have ever seen.\n\nThere were several things to visit like ice palace and experience the\rbreathtaking panoramic view from the Sphinx Observation Terrace\roverlooking the Aletsch Glacier (Europe\u0026rsquo;s longest glacier). After\rgetting down from the train we first went to Swiss-sphinx. It was the\rhighest point of the whole place. We went outside onto the observation\rdeck and relished the views. As parts of the observation deck extended\rpast the building, the floor beneath us was made up of metal grates.\rLooking down, it was making me feel giddy Santanu was bold enough to\rtake me around the whole building. Day was really bright and sunny as if\rmeant for taking pictures so throughout whole trip we took plenty of\rphotos.\n\nFrom there we went to ice palace. This consisted of basically an\runderground ice sculpture exhibition. Everything was ice; the ceilings,\rthe walls and even the floors. Something really amazing. From there we\rwent to snow where one can slide or do James Bond stuns on a ropeway.\nThe trip to Mt. Jungfrau will undoubtedly remain among the first things\rwe think back on. What a difference some nice weather made for us that\rday.

Reward on going\rto top is magnificent panorama of Alpine peaks crowding around the\rconvoluted contours of Lake Lucerne. While going up it was a nice\rweather but slowly \u0026amp; slowly it started getting dark. On a clear day it\rseems one can see Mount Titlis.\nPerhaps the most glorious hike I’ve enjoyed in Switzerland is from Rigi\rKulm to Vitznau. This trail is not listed in the guide map.

I believe most people prefer to hike up but\rit was just opposite in our case. The first part till Rigi Kaltbad\r(1438m) is easy.

After we\rtook funicular ride to Madonna del Sasso.\nWe were determined to take glacier express from Andermatt to St.Moritz\rtoday. So, by 9.00 we reached station; Santanu saw a BBC program about\rWilhelm Express on TV and was eager to board the same from Locarno till\rit connects Glacier Express. But due to train schedules we had to take\ran inter-regional train from Locarno to Goschenen via Bellinzona. Our\rcompartment was vacant with two of us only. That left us to hop from one\rside to another in order to take photos as the train made turns to gain\raltitude. Being a standard train the chief advantage is the windows\rgenerally can be opened, for cool air and unobstructed views and take\rpicture – with no ghost image.\n *\nOn reaching Goschenen we immediately boarded another train to Andermatt\rwhere we spent an hour taking photos. Swiss trains are like Swiss\rwatches never late-always on time so was Glacier Express\n\nThis train actually starts from St.Moritz to Zermatt or vice versa which\ris of 7 1/2 hr. journey across 291 bridges, through 91 tunnels and\racross the Oberalp Pass at 2033 m altitude. It’s really incredible\rjourney via beautiful landscapes with valleys, glistening mountains \u0026amp;\rsplendid greenery. It’s a train with huge wrap-around windows, allowing\ryou to see through part of the ceiling no wonder why visitor do not\rcomplain spending bucks. You never know how alpine panoramas hits right\rin the face unless you experience it. But, the windows in the panoramic\rcars generally can\u0026rsquo;t be opened, means photographs usually come with a\rglare.\n *\nAs soon as we boarded the train, memories from Bollywood movies got\rrefreshed. As there are umpteen of songs featured on this train.\rUnfortunately, we did not have window seats. And as it was mid-day lots\rof people were having their lunch at their seat. The dining car was next\rcompartment to ours; we spent a good time there. Glacier express is a\rvery touristy train as people from every corner of the world try to\rtaste Swiss Alpine beauty. We had good conversation with our\rco-passengers who were Americans staying at Saudi Arabia.\nOn reaching St.Moritz we had a nice meal freshly prepared at Railway\rrestaurant. As staying in the classic alpine resort was out of our\rbudget so it was more economical to board a train for final destination\rto Zurich via Chur.\nThe train back from St-Moritz was a normal one which was good as that\rallowed us to take pictures with out glare. The journey from Chur to\rZurich was also very scenic as the train runs along two lakes - Lake\rWalen and Lake Zurich.\n","excerpt":"Today we got up very early to take a quick trip of city as we did wanted\rto go back to snow clad beauty of Switzerland instead of its\rMediterranean lake shores.

The main attraction of the village is the church of “Santuario\rdella Madonna del Sangue”. The original church was build around 14th\rcentury but then it was expanded later on. Its structure is more like\rByzantine one then the gothic which are more common in this part of\rEurope.\nOn reaching at Locarno they were so much worried for us that they even\rhelped us in looking for a hotel by asking there local friends \u0026amp; dropped\rus to the same.

The train journey to Visp was nice as it gave the taste of Alps\rand its beautiful mountain ranges. The bus trip from Visp to Saas Fee\rwas magnificent. We initially wanted to get the Glacier express today\ritself but being a special train we could not connect the same. So we\rspent only 20 minutes at Saas Fee also called pearl of Alps. Saas Fee is\ra very beautiful car-free resort nestling at foot of glaciers One local\ryoung gentleman invited us to little Himalaya of Europe while getting\rdown from the bus. There we had our ‘take away’ lunch.\nOn our way back we continued till Brig by the same bus. From Brig we had\rtwo choices – either by a train or bus. Train goes to our next\rdestination in the south of Switzerland via long tunnel while bus takes\ra longer route through Simplon Pass to some remote village of Italy from\rwhere we were to take a train after 2 hours to our today’s destination\r(Locarno).\n\nWell, Santanu insisted on later uncertain one as we would have reached\rLocarno at 21:30 and we had no hotel booked for that night. No doubt the\rjourney along this pass was breathtaking almost 2005m above sea level.\rAs soon as we reached border station we were only 2 passengers left from\rthe bus and we were transferred to a mini van where we had only one\rco-passenger. It was quite assuring that someone is going with us as it\rwas already 5:30 PM quite late for a place in absolute no-where. We were\rtold by our co-passenger in broken English and Italian that there will\rbe a bus in next 5 minutes, but that 5 become 25 and we three are\rwaiting for bus. There is no posted time table of the same. We started\rto realize that we were in Italy from the very systematic and punctual\rSwitzerland. It was quandary that we were in.The last part of today’s journey to\rLocarno was a very memorable one as we got rescued by two gentle Swiss.\nIn short, trip via road across the most beautiful Alpine passes with\rspectacular views over the snow covered mountains, through narrow\rwinding valleys, lakes and picturesque villages is something amazing.\n","excerpt":"Till we are not sure what would be our next destination for today. The\rnearest attraction is Montreaux, but that being so close to Lausanne we\rwere discussing to keep it for last day. After taking a hearty breakfast\rwe reached railway station. We asked at the information desk about the\rSwiss travel pass and Post Bus.\nTraveling with yellow Swiss post bus system is really breath taking\rexperience as they connect any place in Switzerland which can’t be\rreached by train.","ref":"https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-15-post-bus-19th-june/","title":"Post Bus - 19th June"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/saas-fee/","title":"Saas Fee"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/simplon-pass/","title":"Simplon Pass"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/swiss-post/","title":"swiss post"},{"body":"Finally, world cup football came to an end where France lost to Italy.\rFor me France lost but at same time Italy neither win as they just\rwaited for the final penalty shoot out to happen.

And this\rtime the whole nation is waiting for the verdict of match fixing in\rItalian league. Well there must be google of blogs and news on the same\rbut I could not stop making my post. This post is not about what\rhappened in the last 10 minutes of the final match.\nFIFA at least should change the rules and make it like tennis when there\rwill be at least 2 goals difference for penalty shoot out; as just one\rgoal difference makes it similar to toss a coin to find the winner.\nWell being in Paris it makes it special when France is playing the\rfinal. France is a team which had great difficulties in qualifying for\rthe world cup with a draw against Israel but at the end they entered\rgroup ‘G’ as top and found Switzerland again in the same group like the\rqualifier. In the first 2 matches of the world cup they did not played\rany thing great that one can expect them to be in Final. But in the\rknock out stage they really played well and they deserve their well\rearned place in the final.\n A big credit goes to Zidane, and once again he reached the status of a\rGod in France. But the way it ended will remain controversial for years\rto come. May be like that of 1986 Quarter Final between Argentina and\rEngland. Where every one talks about the first goal of Maradona which\rwas a clear hand ball and he should have seen a red-card for that but no\rone talks about the very next goal where he beat 6 English player before\rscoring one of the beautiful goal of all time to my memory.\n Yes, it was a good match but the face of French man on Monday after the\rfinal was so pathetic that looked like they lost every thing to a\rnatural disaster or something. In France, I am sure this incident is\rgoing to be in the media for a long time unless they win world cup soon\rand forget all about.\n","excerpt":"Finally, world cup football came to an end where France lost to Italy.\rFor me France lost but at same time Italy neither win as they just\rwaited for the final penalty shoot out to happen.

Although these are my\rpersonal views and I do not have many French contacts so my observation\rmight be wrong.\nAny way, yesterday we were discussing about the possible outcome of the\rlast two quarter finals of this Football world cup 2006. The worst\rscenario for French would have been beaten by Brazil and England wining\rtheir respective match against Portugal. The “so so” situation would be\rstill loosing to Brazil but England also lost their match. As at least\rthey can face their worst neighbors “les anglais”.\nAccording to me, Simple Fête would have been that French and England win\rand they both play Semi-Final.

Then also after too much of\rthinking we settled for Morocco and started to gather touristic\rinformation. It may be a backyard for most French but being Indian it\rmeans we need to get visa.

Either line is busy or it gets dropped on half way when they try\rto pass the call.\nAnyway, we went to there embassy in-person for submitting all documents\rwhich went on very smoothly; women in-charge said it will take 15 days\rto get our visa. On asking whether we should buy ticket for Morocco?\rhmm\u0026hellip; its OK to get it and sends us to her higher authority to get it\rconfirmed. Now this Monsieur says gently\u0026hellip; after 10 days you should get\rit without any problem so its OK to buy ticket. Being excited we started\rto plan our trip and get more information. But Santanu being skeptical\rnever showed any interest in buying the ticket and always postponed the\rsame. But at same time he was so excited that just day before his CISM\rtest he made a phone call to find out VISA status. Well it was negative,\rhe went to consulate in-person on Monday 12th June and found the same\rnegative answer and was told to come by on Thursday 15th June to take\rvisa for a journey that was supposed to start on Saturday 17th. Well,\rThursday didn’t bring any luck either which made Santanu\rfurious.\nIts well said \u0026ldquo;man proposes and god disposes\u0026rdquo;. The whole euphoria\rvanished like a whiff of smoke as neither on 10th nor on 15th day of\rsubmission we got VISA. Since this holidays were forced one which means\rif Santanu doesn’t uses it he doesn’t gain anything.\n\nThere was one backup plan for Morocco, but it was never in place as we\rnever thought seriously, the plan was to touch cities-towns of France\rthat we have not visited yet like Nice, Bordeaux, Bayonne and Chamonix\ralong with some part of Swiss. Well it might sound bit crazy idea but\rtruly we are crazy when it comes to traveling. Now the search for last\rminute ticket started. Since there were no discounted ticket on SNCF web\rsite and the only ticket that we could grab was round-trip from Paris to\rLausanne on Friday 16th. At once started to make phone calls to our\rfriends who have already been there.For this trip, Santanu wanted to\rtravel with his big red North Face backpack and he was not interested to\rmake any plans on itenary or any pre-bookings for hotels.

Rain or shine, the markets start early in the\rmorning and close around 1:30 p.m. So, its best to go early in the\rmorning as they do become crowded with Parisians doing their weekly\rshopping.\nOne at Boulogne we came to know recently after our 3 years stay at\rParis. Here, you get every thing in cheap price….and also fresh items\rseems like just from garden. Freshness of the raw products itself\rincreases the appetite of one. Not only food items even beaded jewelries\rto clothes, utensils to electronic kitchen wares are available. While\rtaking these photos I was asked from which journal I belong …..whether I\ram from Pakistan, even one said for taking photos its 10 euros.

This airline is based in Doha, Qatar covering\raround 70 international destinations. Check-in at Paris was very smooth\rthough they were very strict about luggage weight.\n\nIn-flight service was good with very comfortable seats having enough leg\rroom; quality of the food was better than what we had before and was\rgood with choice of films and music on demand. In short, good service\rfor almost 7-8hrs.of long haul flight. What let the airline down was\rground services at Doha airport which was awful. Too congested, with no\rseats, toilets overloaded. There you can see all South-Asians in blue\rcollar jobs. Services at airport were very poorly managed.\n\nQatar generously gave free dinner coupon for 4 hours stop-over in the\rage of no-frill air lines. Finding a long queue and no place to seat we\ropted for a quick stroll in the small duty free section. Having all\rkinds of perfume from France, small souvenirs, wines, cigarettes and YES\rlast but not least is our yellow metal (gold) shop. Where every\rIndian was making a pilgrimage. Truly, wherever \u0026amp; whatever the price of\rgold be India’s fascination towards it will not lessen.

But it is the most\rimportant city in the entire Eastern Himalayas due to its geographical\rlocation. As city is unabashedly an industrial centre and gateway to\rseven sisters of North-East along with Sikkim \u0026amp; eastern part of Nepal.\rMy parents moved here ten years back and by that time I had just started\rmy career; never had ample holidays to explore any thing around. Always\rI used to be too tired to get out of home and end up with novels and old\rmusic. But this was for the first time I did take days out to visit\rGangtok.\nThough journey was not very memorable or different than that of those I\rhad while growing up in North-East region except that Pamela was with me\rthis time. Traveling by Jeep through those narrow winding roads is an\rexperience in itself where our co-passengers thought that we are going\rfor honeymoon trip. The drive was very scenic with Teesta River flowing\rall the way. The forested hills are still green but truly there is\rcontinuous deforestation going on for either cultivation or smuggling\rwoods.\n\nWe reached Gangtok after midday and the Taxi Stand was the most active\rpart of the city like any other small or hill town in North-East. There\rare too many touts to rob you. If you travel light and are able to carry\ryour luggage yourself you can avoid them. We stayed in a ITDC hotel near\rto M.G.Marg where we had our lunch at its expensive restaurant. Then we\rwent out for booking our trips for sightseeing \u0026amp; daytrip for next 2\rdays. Being a tourist place it seems everyone wants to rob so you need\rto have good negotiating skill \u0026amp; make sure what you need you get the\rsame. After bargaining we were able to book our trips for next 2 days.\rThen from there we went to the Government Institute of Cottage\rIndustries (also called the Directorate of Handicrafts and Handloom)\rwhich promotes and teaches the ancient crafts of Sikkim (like painting,\rmask making, weaving, wood carving) to keep them alive. It is located at\rzero point, few km uphill from the main Gangtok town.\nDay II, we had Allu paratha as breakfast early morning near to\rBus stop at Agarwal restaurant \u0026amp; got the same packed for the route also.\rThen we headed towards our agency. Indians are famous for their IST so\rour co-passengers. After waiting a while for them to join we started our\rtrip to Tsomgo Lake.\nTsomgo Lake is situated at an altitude of 12,310 ft on\rGangtok-Nathula highway. Just few kilometers away from Indo-China\rborder. This road also continues to Lasa, Tibet. Drive to that region\ris again very different with snow capped mountains \u0026amp; this whole belt is\rundertaken by Indian military. Salute to our Indian army who are taking\rpain to guard those borders to make our life easy \u0026amp; peaceful. Really I\rwonder sometimes how they are struggling there to earn their meal in\rthose extreme cold regions far from there near one.\n\nOn reaching Tsomgo lake (pronounced as Changu Lake which means source of\rlake) we hired snow boots as all the travel agents take their customers\rto respective brothers stall for hiring jackets, snow boots and\rwater-proof boots. Because of the high altitude heavy woolens are\rrequired which we already had.\nFrom there we went immediately to Baba Harbhajan Singh Memorial\rwhich lies between Nathula-Jelepla pass which is at still more\rhigher altitude of around 13,450ft. Actually, it is built in memory of a\rsepoy of 23rd Punjab regiment. It seems after few days of his missing he\rappeared in the dreams of his fellow comrades \u0026amp; expressed a desire that\rmonument be built in his memory. Now it has acquired a statue of a\rpilgrimage, being Sunday there was langar (free meals served after\rSikh services) offered by Indian Army. After one hour stay we came down\rto Changu Lake.\nWeather was getting worse. Tea, snacks \u0026amp; film rolls are available at the\rdozen of temporary stalls near the lake. But there is no facility of\raccommodation or proper toilet for the tourist. Rides on yaks and mules\rare also offered which was worthless to enjoy for Pamela at that\rtemperature.\nIn the evening, we walked on the main street of M.G.Marg which is\rnormally closed for all vehicles from 5 to 9 PM. Looked for budget\rrestaurant for our dinner; we found one and also found a long queue\rwaiting for their turn. The wait was delightful.\nDay\rIII started for us early morning as we wanted to return to Siliguri\rASAP. We started our sightseeing activity from Rumtek monastery\r(largest monastery of Sikkim) and ended with exotic orchid show\ralong with Enchey monastery, Do-drul stupa.\nGangtok is a blend of the traditional and modern, where modern concrete\rmulti-storied structures clings to the hillside along with stupas and\rmonasteries; buddhist prayer flags flutter with the mountain breeze;\ryoung college girls in trendy dresses while elderly matrons clad in\rtraditional \u0026lsquo;bakus\u0026rsquo; and lamas in colorful maroon.\n Now, looking forward to travel to North Sikkim some day which we heard\ris more beautiful with valley of flowers and lakes to explore.\n ","excerpt":"My current home in India is Siliguri, north of West Bengal may not\rbe the most alluring for tourist destinations.

If you have grown up with\rgreen devil with a tail and a broken TV advertisement I am sure\ryou know what I am talking about.\nYES! the famous ONIDA first advertisement that stirred Indian middle\rclass. Before that the advertisement agencies did not dared to cross any\rtaboo that could be controversial and backfire on them. Well, later\rthanks to Pooja Bedi we Indian got some maturity in advertisement ;)\nThe ONIDA advertisement was simple; it was about a TV which was supposed\rto be so good that neighbor throws a stone and breaks it due to sheer\ramount of envy. So the message was to get some different idiot box then\ryour neighbors and show it off. At the end in Indian middle class every\rbody wanted to be different and lots of them got ONIDA which made them\rall living in same kind of glass houses. To me it was as good as any\rother mid-range TV for that price. But unfortunately those new proud\rONIDA owners found themselves that they can\u0026rsquo;t tell each other over a cup\rof tea that they got 30 channels in their new TV to watch DD1 (Indian\rNational TV Network). Well those are the stories of 80s but campaign of\rONIDA remains same till today. You can read more on the same and check\rONIDA latest advertisement\rat their web site.\nI am not sure who is envying whom - is it me who is envying at\rothers who passes me with whooping speed in their big fat German SUVs or\rsomeone reading this finds it as a cool ride to work.\n\nI tried my best to add this from Google maps.

From there it took another\r20 minutes or so to reach the final destination near Zoological Garden.\rWe took a taxi and the ride was a short one to our hotel for only 6\rEuros. The driver was nice and he was mentioning about the drought\rPortugal is facing.\nThe Hotel (Novotel) was under renovation but the staff was kind enough\rto get us a room at 4:30 in the morning although we had by mistake\rbooked for only one adult which we came to knew then and there.\nAfter having rest for few hours we headed out from our hotel to Lisbon\rdowntown by metro. It was a very cloudy day. I was feeling heavy headed\rand wanted to get some coffee.\nAfter\rwalking in Rossio Square for a while we bought day pass for Lisbon\rTrasport. The Metro system is run by the Government while the Bus, Tram\rand trolleys are run by a company. Lisbon have lots of trams and it\rseems like one of the attractions. Lisbon downtown is divided in three\rmajor part Bairro Alto, Alfama and Baixa. The first two one are on hills\rand the last one in the middle of the two.\nIt took us a while to figure out the starting point of Gloria funicular.\rWe took it to reach the top of Bairro Alto Neighborhood. The ride is\rvery small and full of tourists only. At the end of the 2/3 minute ride\rthe people who bought a single trip ticket was wondering is it really\rworth or not.\nJust getting out of the funicular on the right towards hill there is\rpark, from there we get very nice view of the other part of the city and\rthe river from there. There is also the ‘Porto’ wine collection place\rjust across the street. Start walking downhill towards Chiado. Chaido is\rvery happening place with lots of designer shops and places to east and\rdrink. We visited Sao Roque Church which is very beautiful with lots of\rexcellent tile and marble works inside; it was built in the glory days\rof Portugal.\nWe had lunch in one of the restaurant of big mall in Baixa Chaido. After\rthat we took tram 28 for going to Alfama. This one is also a old tram\rmost likely built in 1930s and it passes Baixa district. We visited the\rCaste of São Jorge. After spending a good time and taking the view of\rLisbon \u0026amp; River Tejo we took the same tram back to Chiado. In Chaido we\rtook Bica funicular which is like Gloria a old one but it is very stiff\rand goes down to the river front. The buildings along side are very old\rand in poor condition.\nOnce reaching the river front we took tram 15 towards Belem. There are\rboth new and old tram on this track. Belem is 5 KM outside of Lisbon. On\rthe way we saw 25th April Bridge, which just looks like Golden Gate\rbridge of San Francisco. The reason may be both are built by the same\rcompany. Belem tower and Monastery are the main attractions along with\rthe ‘Monument to the Discoveries’.Well it was a quite a long day and we\rheaded back to Chiado for dinner and then to Hotel.\n","excerpt":"Well the over night bus journey between Seville and Lisbon was not very\rlong one.

Plaza de Espana was built for 1929 world expo.\rLots of Latin American countries joined that expo. The world expo was\rnot a success as that year was marked as first financial disaster of the\rGreat Depression as U.S. securities lost $26 billion.\nThe famous tile work of Andalusia is at its best here. There are maps of\rSpain from that time; the benches, the small decorative bridges are\rreally beautiful. We walked along the great corridors of Spanish\rPavilion. From there we walked to Alcazar while we saw the university\rand the famous 5star hotel. The university used to be a cigarette\rfactory before.\nKing Pedro Castile in the 1360\u0026rsquo;s with his mistress Maria de Padilla,\rlived in and ruled from the Alcazar. Pedro embarked upon a complete\rrebuilding of the palace, employing workmen from Granada and utilising\rfragments of earlier Moorish buildings in Seville, Cordoba and Valencia.\rThe comparison between Alhambra is like comparing apple and orange. This\ris build with lot of confusing room. The outside garden is really\rbeautiful which worth a stroll.\nAs that day was religious holiday with procession and big gathering of\rpeople around the cathedral. We walked along the cathedral towards city\rhall and further. After lunch we rested inside a café for 2 hours to\rbeat the scorching heat.\nWe took a bus to visit Basilic of Macarena, the weeping Mary which is\rworld famous. We walked back all the way from there to Plaza de Espana.\rIt is better to visit west facing Plaza de Espana in the evening for\rphotos.\nAfter all that walking we were really tired and exhausted. We had tapas\ragain for dinner next to our hotel. It was a better place with street\rside seating. We really enjoyed my food with cool breeze and watching\rpeople on the street.\nTaxi ride to the bus stop for Lisbon was a good choice at late night.\rBut waiting for the midnight bus was not fun.

We bought ticket for AVE (fast train) to Cordoba. The\rfair is not at all expensive compared to French standard as it costs\ralmost similar from Paris CDG airport to city center. The train service\ris really good and train travels in high speed.\nCordoba’s main attraction is its Mezquita(Mosque). This is a living\rhistory of Cordoba as it transforms from one culture and religion to\rother. It was one of the first big city that was built by Moorish rulers\rin Spain at 10th century. These leaders wanted to build a mosque for\rtheir religion. Earlier the mosque was small but with time as Cordoba\rprospered, it was extended to accommodate more people.\nThe double arch with red and white stripes makes a very immense effect\rto the visitors. These double arches are purely for decorative purpose\rbut it is so unique. Later days when Christians gained their control\rover Cordoba this was converted to a Church with very little\rmodification giving it a feeling of church inside the mosque.\n\nThe `Mihrab` traditionally had two functions in Islamic worship,\rfirst it indicated the direction of Mecca (therefore prayer) and it also\ramplified the words of the Imam, the prayer leader. But The Cordoba\rMosque Mihrab looks south in the same way as the Damascus mosque and not\rsouth east in the direction of Mecca. This one is very beautifully\rdecorated with Islamic arts of gold on marble.\nFrom there we went around various streets exploring beautiful patios of\rCordoba. Best time is early May to visit the same. There is a\rcompetition for most beautiful patio in Cordoba, which means lots of\rpatios to check out in early May.\nWe had a light snack of fruits and juice near to Alcazar. The afternoon\rwas scorching hot. After waiting a good amount of time for the public\rbus we took a taxi back to train station. The ride in the AC car was\rworth (4 Euros) every penny as the outside was burning at 40 C.\n","excerpt":"When we started planning for Andalusia we did not thought of\rCordoba first.

The bus ride was around 2 hours and 45 minutes. From that\rIntercityBus stop to our hotel (again Novotel) we took again local\rpublic bus. But we got down 2 stops before the actual stop which ended\rup with a walk along the nice boulevard of Seville.\nAs we reached before afternoon there was no non-smoking room available\rto us. So left our luggage \u0026amp; went to a Mall next to our hotel.We had our\rlunch that day at McDonald which is really a restaurant where you don\u0026rsquo;t\rfeel like you are eating 99 cent burgers. Hmm\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;.money well spent\rfor the interior decoration of this McDo, may be one of those new one\rwhere McDo is fighting back to win its market share.\nWe started our sightseeing around 5PM after fresh up with the Cathedral\rof Seville which has its entry in ‘Guinesses book of world Records'. Its\rreally BIG we had been to Vatican (Rome) and St. Paul in London but this\rone is really special. All the money, gold, silver and what not poured\rfrom New-World shows its mark. May be like those of Birla Temples of\rIndia - more the money bigger and whiter it is with marble . But any way\rI am not going to question human’s faith and its relation with God like\rpoet Shri. Harivansh Rai Bachchan. The treasury collection is awesome.\rThe craftsmanship of wood, marble, glass and others are really superb.\rThere are so many things inside to pay attention to. The Bell tower is\rthe only remain from the old mosque on which this cathedral was built\rafter the moors were defaulted.\n\nGetting out of Cathedral, we walked on Santa Cruz district. It is the\rold part of the city. The lanes are really narrow; some of them reminded\rme of Vanaras and Calcutta. It has special purpose: as the houses are so\rclose they do not get sunlight that much which makes them cooler than\rthe new city. There are lots of nice little parks and patios with orange\rtrees one of the speciality of Andalusia. These trees serves the purpose\rof shade as it has got very dense leaves. But we were told these oranges\rare very bitter .\nThe evenings are really special in Seville when every body is out to\rtake a stroll. It is really nice to enjoy watching people while sipping\rsomething cooler and biting tapas.This city is very lively \u0026amp; warm\rtoo.Here, temperature is very high in afternoon around 40C \u0026amp; it cools\rdown by evening 7-8PM with a cool breeze.\nIn the evening we ended up walking on the Bridge of Triana after passing\rthe bull fight Arena. We had Paella for dinner. Paella is a rice-based\rspeciality which is laced with saffron, paprika and can contain\rintriguing morsels of seafood, meat and vegetable.It was almost midnight\rbut there were lots of people even toddlers along with their parents on\rthe side walk.\nWhile walking back toward the bus stop for hotel we came across a\rresturant with lots of tempting , mouth watering desserts kept near the\rwindow on the road side. As this place was too crowded with locals \u0026amp;\rtourists we didnot found any place to sit \u0026amp; have dessert.But, we were\ralso no less\u0026hellip; we managed to get two chairs to sit \u0026amp; ordered for the\rsame(just imagine how tempting it could be that without table \u0026amp; proper\rarrangment we had our dessert).Anyway, we enjoyed it very\rmuch\u0026hellip;..something we can never forget.\n","excerpt":"I\rshould have started jotting down all my memories from this beautiful\rcity immediately after my return to Paris.

As I have never been to Taj Mahal\rI can not say for certain but I am quite sure it is not that close to\rTaj Mahal in beauty. Still the works of Moorish artists are really very\rappreciable.We spent a good amount of time in Palacios Nazaries, from there we went\rto Generalife via beautiful garden of roses. From there we visited\r\u0026lsquo;Palace of Charles V\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Alcazaba\u0026rsquo;. This makes the four attraction of\rAlhambra.\nAfter siesta, we went to the Cathedral and walked around there. That\revening while strolling we came across Mexican Restaurant - \u0026ldquo;Chile\rGrande\u0026rdquo;. The food was really excellent which reminded me of my\rCalifornian days.\n","excerpt":"We did not book our tickets for Alhambra before coming to Granada. There\rcan be 8,000 visitors inside Alhambra in a given day. Out of those 8,000\raround 6,500 are sold over internet \u0026amp; phone. So for us, it meant getting\rup early and queuing up in the morning. As it was Monday and not peak of\rtourist season\u0026hellip; we were lucky.\n\nAlhambra has main 4 sites to visit.\rThe main attraction is of course \u0026ldquo;Palacios Nazaries\u0026rdquo; the best preserved\rMoorish Palace in Europe.","ref":"https://santm.com/blog/2005-05-23-alhambra-granada-spain/","title":"Alhambra - Granada - Spain"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/granada/","title":"Granada"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/moorish-architecture/","title":"Moorish architecture"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://santm.com/tags/moorish-palace/","title":"Moorish Palace"},{"body":"The temperature in Spain was quite hot compared to Paris.

We entered into two churches while\rwalking along the Darro River. They were small churches compared to the\rcathedral but also have nice wood work. Then we walked uphill towards St\rNicolas Church in El Albaicín\nIt is on hill top from where you can have a\rgreat view of Alhambra at the sunset. The cobble stone roads are really\rnarrow. There are lots of tourists at that view point in the evening so\rare gypsies. They were playing music and selling their art\rworks.As we had time before the sunset we walked down a bit and went to\rSacromonte. There are gypsy caves most of which are now converted into\rhouses. But there is one part left for historic and touristy purpose.\nThen we came back to The Church of San Nicolás. I am quite sure if you\rbeen there recently you must be knowing Bill Clinton also re-visited\rthis place while he was President as he was here once as a young\rstudent. Well even with out his historic visit this place at the sunset\ris really great to look at the red fort – Alhambra.\nThis is one of the photos that were there in that Smart Card Media with\rwhich we had problem.

We started our trip with flight from Paris to Madrid on\rSaturday 21st May 2005.\nWe reached Charles de Gaulle Airport on time and the checking was smooth\rbut after boarding the plane we were in ground for almost one hour\rbefore taking off. The cost cutting measures with European state\rcarriers are all alike now, so there is no free snacks \u0026amp; drinks in the\rshort flight. By the time we reached Madrid in the afternoon we were\rvery hungry. We got into the Metro from Airport to our Hotel which\rinvolved dragging our luggage for 10 minutes or so. The hotel was again\r‘Novotel’, this one was not that outside one like that of Vienna but not\rvery close to the Metro like Berlin. But we found this one is quite OK\rwith public transportation as there is a Bus stop just outside the hotel\rwhich takes to the center of Madrid – Sol.\nAfter freshen up we headed towards Sol, after reaching there we had a\rvery late lunch in a Falafel place. It was great – cheap price – tasty\rand fresh food.\nAfter that we started our walk tour towards Royal Palace via Plaza\rMayor. This walk is a kind of an introductory tour referred in any\rtravel guide book. We took lot of pictures of the beautiful ceiling of\rthe royal church, decorated with bright colors. From there we headed\rmore south towards the Basilic.\nOur dinner was not\rup-to mark. As dining section of Rick Steve\u0026rsquo;s guide book is quite empty.\rThere are plenty to choose from when it comes to eating as Spaniards\rhave great passion about gastronomy.After dinner we walked from Sol\rtowards East to “Banco de Espana” and we tried to capture few nice big\rwhite buildings in night mode with tripod.\nNext day morning we checked out from hotel and started our Bus journey\rto Granada. We were very lucky to get to the bus station on time to\rboard the bus to Granada with out any wait. The five and half hour long\rsmooth \u0026amp; comfortable ride with one break gave us view of Spain’s\ragricultural rich country side.

But in real world the metro station is 5 or 6\rKM away and there is a bus which runs every one or two hours between the\rmetro station and the hotel.\nThe evening we reached was bit late around 11PM so I decided to take a\rcab from the airport to the hotel. The hotel people told me it cost\raround 35 euros from the Airport to the hotel. But it cost us 54 Euros\rso I was very angry with the Taxi driver at first for taking longer\rroutes. But when I asked again with the hotel guy he said it is normally\raround 60 Euros. Well that made me feel good but not better.\nNext day, Saturday, we went to Melk by train from Vienna the weather was\rgreat with blue sky and warm temperature. The train ride was nice as it\rgives a good view of Austria’s country side. Melk has a very beautiful\rabbey which is known as Stift to the local. From there we took a boat\rride on Danube River to Kermes. While walking from the boat stop to the\rtrain station we met a lady from Graz. She suggested us to take the\rtrain ride to her beautiful town in the Alps on any sunny morning.\nThat evening we came back to Vienna and walked around StephansPlatz and\rdined in a vegetarian place, the food was good.\nSunday we had our coffee and some tasty pastries to start the day. We\rwalked along the ring starting from Opera, Hufburg Palace, City hall,\rMuseum Quarter Parliament, University and the stock Market. After that\rwe went to St. Augustine’s Church to listen the Sunday Chores. It was a\rvery different experience the music and singing was really very soothing\rto ears. After lunch we went to Belvedere Palace. It was very special\rday as Austria was celebrating its 50 years of Freedom. There was live\rmusic, dance in different form. We really enjoyed those great outdoor\rperformances.\nOn our last day we went to Schonbrunn (beautiful fountain) palace. It\rwas summer residence of the royal. Its beautiful park really demands a\rgood amount of time from you to explore those lavish green\rsurroundings.\nWell that brought to an end and we were back to the airport for our\rafternoon flight to Paris.\n","excerpt":"We just finished uploading pictures from our Vienna trip to our site.

We started with Blois, this\rcastle was built by four generation in four different style. It started\rwith Gothic style but later the Renaissance and other part were added.\rThis castle is not very big compared to other castles witch was lived by\rthe kings. But it always had special importance in terms of the power.\nFrom Blois we went to Chenonceau, this one is famous for its garden. It\ris also known as ladies castle as it was construction works were\rsupervised by ladies. It was build by Briaonnet family but later used by\rCatherine de Medici widow of King Henry II.

We figured out from all the guidebooks and Internet that all the\rmajor historical sites are quite far from each others. As we had no plan\rfor renting and driving we opted a guided tour for the main attractions.\rWe were very skeptical initially but at the end it turned to be very\rgood meeting new people and quality of service was very good. After\rfinishing our 5-day trip we went back to Athens and from there we went\rto Santorini. The most famous Cycladic island in the Aegean Sea where I\rrealized I got one more year older. We started from Paris Friday evening\rand reached at midnight.\nDay-1\nWe started our day early as the tour bus picked us at 7:20AM. After\rgetting transferred to another bus we headed out of Athens on Saturday\rmorning. The first we made was at Corinth Canal 80 KM south of\rAthens.\nThis is a manmade canal 6 kilometer long which connects Gulf of Corinth\rin northwest and Sardonic Gulf in the southeast. Ancient Greeks knew the\rimportance of this location. Journey between Aegean and Adriatic was\rother wise longer around Peloponnese. The canal was built in 1890.\nBefore the canal was build the old Greeks started using a unique\rtechnique in the years of 600 BC. They made a stone road and then\rtransferred the ships from one side to the other over a wheeled platform\rknown as `diolkos`.\nFrom there we went to visit the remains of Mycenae civilization. This\rsite is one of oldest site in Greek civilization. The first was around\r4000BC but the peak was around 1200 BC late Bronze Age. Next to it is\rMycenaean tholos tomb, it consists of circular burial chamber with a\rlong passage. The keystone is at the center of dome. And it used to\rplace very delicately fearing the structure will collapse in itself if\rthe pressure was too much.\n\nAfter lunch we vised Epidaurus. Theatre of Ancient Epidaurus has the\rbest natural accosting where the sound is heard all over the theater\rwith same volume and clarity. The factors are the oval shape, the stones\rthat are used and most of the air that is blowing from stage to\raudience.\nFrom there we went to Nafplion we spent the evening and night there.\rNafplion was the capital for Greece when it was getting out of Ottoman\rrules before capital was moved to Athens.\nDay-2 Olympia\n\nWe visited the ancient site of Olympia where Olympic games used to\rhappen 2500 years ago. In the sanctuary of Olympia principal temple is\rtemple of Zeus. Other important buildings are, temple of Hera (wife and\rsister of Zeus) and the Philippeion built by Philip-II father of\rAlexander the Great. The stadium is still there which is around 200\rmeters long. In olden days only Greeks were allowed to take part in the\rgame.\nThe museum also hold lots of objects in marble, bronze from this site.\rGreeks do complain about French that they looted artifacts to Louvre\rwhen they started the first excavation in 1829. Now it is German and\rGreek who looks after the current excavation.\nDay-3 Delhi\nThis was a long bus journey as we cross the Peloponnese and went to?\rGreek main-land. On the way we crossed the recently inaugurated\rsuspended bridge at Rio.\n\nWe stopped at one Greek shop for a small break. Then we passed by the of\rPort of Nafpaktos. The journey included lots of twisted turns to reach\rthe hill top from sea level.We visited the sanctuary dedicated to Athena\rPronaea. The tholos is the main building here. The Tholos circular\rbuilding in Doric order, built in ca. 380 B.C. Its function remains\runknown but it must have been an important building, judging from the\rmulti-colored stone, the fine workmanship and the high-standard relief\rdecoration. The monument was partly reconstructed in 1938.\nThe Gymnasium was a complex of buildings used by the youths of Delphi\rfor their education and practice. It was constructed in two levels: on\rthe upper was a stoa and a free open space used for running practice,\rand on the lower was the palaestra, the pool and the baths (thermal).\nDay-4 Delphi\nThe day was cloudy and had rain in the morning. We started with the\rsanctuary of Apollo, on the southern tip of the mountain slope. The\rDoric temple was the home of the Pythia, who, seated on a tripod above a\rdeep crevasse, would pronounce her prophecies while the priests wrote\rthem down and translated them to the people.\nRich and powerful people of that time wanted to know the future and the\ranswer was always never straight so it could have been interpretated\r\u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo;.\nDelphi was consider as the center of the world that time as God Appalo\rleft two eagles in opposite direction to find the center and they meet\rhere at the foothill of Mount Parnassos.\nThen we visited the mesuem of Delphi before heading to wars more north\rto Meteora.\nDay 5 Metora Athens\nIt was raining a lot and the mountains were covered with cloud. We could\rhardly see any thing 3 meters from us. It was bit of disappointment. But\rcould not complain in mid-October with rain. The monastery are built on\rbig rocks. After visiting 2 monastery we started for Athens.\nAfter checking-in a hotel at Athens we went for dinner. It was bit cold\rfor the first time due to sudden rain and gusty winds. We went to a\rItalian place for dinner and the food was too good with fresh bread and\rpasta. On the way back to hotel we captured some prominent buildings at\rnight light.\nDay 6 Athens\n\nIn the morning the sky was clear again and it was very nice day. At\rfirst we booked our tickets to Santorini for that evening .Then we went\rto the Acropolis. The guards were on strike for a pay rise till noon so\rhave to wait a bit there. But standing in the queue early paid off as we\rentered as soon the gate opened. This site have biggest acropolis we\rvisited. There are so many things to see , the reconstruction work is\rgoing on and the museum is quite big.\nFrom there we went to Temple of Olympian Zeus and then we walked back to\rAncient agora. It was lot of walk between these archiological sites back\rand forth; thank God I took my hiking shoes.\nOn our second day at Athens after having a speedy lunch we rushed to\rAthens ferry station. The ferry ride to Santorini was around 9 hours. It\ris long but this was the cheapest way to get there. We reached there\raround 2.00am in the morning\nDay 7 My birth day\nIt was holiday within holiday. As I planned not to visit any more\rarchaeological sites or museum anymore. Got the laundry done, got my\rhair cut; relax was the mantra for that day. I rented a scooter and we\rwent to beach. It was fabulous the water so warm and relaxing. Drove\raround with that little scooter to take picture of those white churches\rwith blue dome.\nDay 8\n\nStill in Santorini took more pictures and rested. After lunch we have to\rstart back for Athens again. Wish we had few more days here. Big KIDDOS\rto Pamela for insisting to include Santorini in our list of place to\rvisit in Greece.\nDay 9\nBack to Athens watched the change of guard at 11AM infront of\rParliament. Did walked in Pacca area again, picked few souvenirs. We\ralso visited here and there to take some pictures of Byzantine Churches\rin particular.\n","excerpt":"After coming back from Italy we were looking for a week long vacation\rand the obvious choice was Greece but waited till Olympics 2004 to\rfinish.

It was not a bad start till the first stop. Then, the inside\rof the bus got converted to allow people to sleep; this is quite unique\runless you have traveled once in any of those I am not sure how to\rexplain. We did not know what it is either and tried to be polite when\rpeople pushed us to go first. But when we got in we found almost all the\rspaces were taken and there was no place left for us together.\nThere was one typical old French lady who occupied the place for two \u0026amp;\rdid not wanted to adjust as there was one more place where another lady\ralso occupied for two and who called themselves sick and lucky (as they\rcame first). Few co-passengers did not like this and were vocal about\rthe same. Some suggested me to get down from the bus to show my protest.\rAny way after the afternoon episode I was not much left to fight with.\rSo, we slept separately somehow and the night ended after all.\nDay-I We reached Marseille on time; after keeping our bags in hotel we left\rfor exploring the second largest city of France.Â Marseille is a very\rbig ugly city; it does not care for your visit. We went to near by\risland on a boat and a very great view of Marseille and Mediterranean\rSea, we visited Notre-Dam and Cathedral followed by a lunch.\nWe were told to meet at hotel at 4:30 for our next destination. But when\rwe reached hotel there was no one and hotel guy gave a key for our room.\rAfter freshen up I asked them where are the rest of the passengers from\rour group. He said coolly \u0026ndash; Oh! They left. What!!!!!\nSo I rushed back to room - told Pamela about the same. So, now after\rseveral questions of her we realized that we were supposed to stay in\rthis Hotel for next 2 nights and the bus will come back. This was\rhighlight of Day two when after having a good time in Marseille we\rmissed the trip to \u0026ldquo;Aix en Provence\u0026rdquo;\nDay-II After a good sleep we did make sure we do not miss any thing today. The\rday was great, we saw \u0026ldquo;Gorges du Verdon\u0026rdquo; which cannot be compared to\rGrand Canyon but it is great in its own. The bus ride to the same was\rreally great. On the way back we stopped at the lake and a small tourist\rvillage.\nDinner on Easter Sunday: most of the restaurants were closed and the\ropen ones were very crowded. We got in to one place to try the Fish Soup\r(Bouillabaisee) speciality of Marseille. So, after waiting a long time\rwaiter took the order and then after a big pause we got the starter; and\rthen again started the eternal wait for main course. There was another\rcouple right to us, who were also waiting for their turn just like us.\rOn left another couple was also bored to wait after drinking their water\rand eating the bread pieces, as there was no one to take their order. It\ralmost took us an hour to get the main course. The scenario was even\rmuch worst in the right table; the husband finished his meal with out\rany bread and there was no food for the wife L till then. As French menu\rconsists of 4 courses so after main course it was to be followed by\rsalad ? but seeing their delay I decided to skip that \u0026amp; thought dessert\rwould be better to opt for ? but no luck; it was just the same. Lastly,\rI decided to leave without taking my dessert. And, they were very prompt\rwhile presenting the bill ? charged for the complete menu no concession\ron their poor service and incomplete meal.\nDAY-III We visited Arles, a place famous for its Roman Arena. There was\rbullfight in the arena that we did not watched but there was Bull race\ron the road before that which was quite memorable.\nThen we moved to Baux-de-Provene a ruin castle visited by too many\rtourists each year. But it was really worth going to the top. The\rpanoramic view of Provence rolling hills is great!\nFrom there we went to Avignon where Pope was moved for few centuries\rbefore going back to Vatican. It has the big church an old bridge that\ris broken in the middle.\nRest of the trip to Paris after dinner was event-less this time as we\rwere given the Premier Entry to the bus and was made sure by well\rwishers that we sleep together that night.Well, Tuesday morning at 5:30\rAM the journey ended which just reminded us to go back to Cite for our\rlong term visa.\n","excerpt":"We have been thinking to visit South of France for a long time.

To explore this city more you need to walk a lot or\rwalking is best way - which we did on our first day of trip.\nSecond day, we went to Montjuic - the place where Olympic Games\rwere held in 1992. Pla?a d?espanya, MNAC, montjuic fountains?etc were\rworth visiting. And it takes complete one day to visit that area.\nIn the Eixample district (heart of the city) most of the buildings,\rbuilt in unique style wereplanned in 1860, which constitutes a unique\rmodel of European urbanplanning. The Sagrada Fam?lia, the Casa Batll?,\rCasa Calvet and the Casa Mil? (also known as La Pedrera) are some\rexamples of this, which was work of Antoni Gaudi. Other then that there\rare Casa lle?

Along with all these it was worth going to (Park G?ell) Gaudi?s\rPark-, which we completed on 3rd day of our trip.\nOn our last day at Barcelona we visited monastery, Palau de la\rm?sica Catalana in Ribera district that is magnificent work of Lluis and\rworld?s one of the most beautiful concert hall. For which advance\rbooking is necessary as its 2 hrs. guided tour and no photography are\rallowed insideL.

So, we planned for only Rome. We\rflew with Alitalia from CDG this time in early morning. It was much\rbetter than Ryan Airlines in terms of access to the airport. But the\rinitial fun started when just before checking-in we have to run 3\rterminals to collect our tickets from Air Traffic office. But other than\rthat running, every thing was smooth. Luckily, we had nothing to\rcheck-in.\nWe started our days visit from Colosseum - just to check if all\rgladiators have gone home or not. I still do not know how to express my\rfeelings about this magnificent achievement of mankind and engineering,\rwhich dates at least 2000 years back. After having lunch we walked along\rVia del Corso from Colosseum to Roman Forum and all the major\rattractions to Fontana di Trevi which refers to the three roads.\rNeedless to say, the famous custom-to throw a coin into the fountain\rover your shoulder to ensure you return to Rome. A second coin will have\ryou falling in love with an Italian, and the third marrying him or her.\rBut we didnot took a trial. Anywayz, on the way we got the taste of\rtraffic rules of Rome. From there we walked towards Spanish Steps\r(Piazza di Spagna) with all the big brand designers shops around it.\rAfter strolling at Piazza del Popolo square we walked to the top of\rthe hill towards Pincio - a nice garden to take some time off under\rshady trees. From here we went to Pantheon via Piazza Navona\ranother city square with fountain of four rivers and Egyptian obelisk in\rthe middle. WOW !!! extraordinary dome of pantheon is the largest\rmasonry vault ever built. Its really magnificent to see that. Finally,\rafter hectic day of walking day long we decided to move towards\rMetro-Colosseum for our hotel.\nSecond day, we planned to visit opulence of the Vatican. So, started\rwith Vatican museum and went to Sistine Chapel. It is must if you want\rto see the work of Michel Angelo and Raphael the great artists of\rItalian Renaissance. Better start this way as museum gets closed early\raround 2PM. From there we went to St. Peters Basilica the main\rVatican church. We went to the top; the lift takes up to 3rd floor which\ris quite at height and from there it is 320 stairs more for the top. The\rview from the top was worth with those narrow stairs.\nLast day, we spent again the whole day for one more last time in ancient\rRome. We went inside of Colosseum and Roman Forum and the Palatine\rHill. Those big structures with columns still standing just as it use\rto be really takes you back to history. After doing a final round of\rwalk which included a late lunch close to Pantheon and walking towards\rPiazza del Popolo on Sunday when most of the road is taken by\rpedestrians we decided to pack-up. That road is really crowded and you\rneed to watch your belongings that time.

We stayed as guest of Sampath, at his home\rbit outside of London. The trip would not have been so pleasant and\rmemorable without his help and warm hospitality.\nWe reached around noon at Waterloo station by Eurostar. After keeping\rour luggage at cloak room we went straight to London Eye. It was a\rnice start to see all the monuments of London from birds view. After\rthat we crossed-river Thames and went in front of Big Ben, Parliament\rand West Minister abbey. We walked through St. James Park and\rreached Buckingham Palace. On the way back towards 10,Downing\rSt. we walked along the Mall. After that we walked to Piccadilly\rSquare when it started to rain. It was a nice little welcome rain of\rLondon. At the end of the day we walked back to Waterloo. It might sound\ra lot of walk around Central London but, we did not found this walk as\rtoo much.\nAfter finishing some top sights, we went to Windsor Castle very next\rday. We spend almost the first part of our day there. Then again we\rreturned to central London to visit Tower of London. If you are\rinterested in seeing all those big and famous diamonds you cannot miss\rthis especially KOHINOOR. Around 3PM we went to HMS Belfast\r-II a WW ship turned into a museum now. It is just across the river.\rThe walk along the river and London Bridge was worth as you get a good\rview of Tower Bridge. Most people confuse that with famous London\rBridge but in-fact London-Bridge is a dull one. After that we went to\rLondon Aquarium on the way we saw St. Paul Cathedral and\rtraveled on those double-decker bus. In the evening, we met Avijit. We\rwere meeting after 8 years after our college days.\nAfter two hectic days of sight seeing we slowed down and started with\rMadam Tussaud. Thanks again to Sampath for advance tickets as that\rsaved at least 40 minutes of long queue. After that we went to British\rmuseum. In the evening we were guest of Purbayan\u0026rsquo;s concert at Royal\rfestival Hall. He along with Kumar Basu made a very wonderful evening\rof Indian classical music in Sitar \u0026amp; Tabla.\n4th Day we were really slow we reached London quite late spend around 2\rhours with Purbayan. We went to Shri Swaminarayana temple in the\rafternoon and then went to Tate Modern. It\u0026rsquo;s a great place to be if\ryou happen to appreciate modern Arts. I personally do not understand\rmuch unless the art is described; there are lots of collections of\rPicasso to Pollock.\nSaturday Sampath drove us to Stonehenge and Bath.

Lots of my friends asked me\rabout our personal opinions on the same before visiting Paris and France\rfor a week or so. So here it is will all the best information that I can\rwrite down with out making it too boring for you.\n\nA brief about Paris:Paris is divided\rin 2 main parts by the River Seine; the left bank and the right.\rTraditionally the city was divided just like a human brain left one for\rart and music where right one for money and power. Now there no such\rdifference any more. It has 20 districts or arrondisement in a snail\rpattern starting at the center of Paris.\nTop attractions: [Not in any particular\rorder]There are lots of Photos from Paris in www.santm.com Eiffel Tower Sacre Coeur Arc de Triomphe Champs Eleysees - and Concorde Notre Dame and Saint Chapel - If possible a cup of coffee on the top\rroof of Samaretine (now closed till 2012) to have the best\rview of Paris Center. But you can try Institute de Monde Arabe . La Defense - Paris version of New York Manhatten. The Mega Stores - Galeries Lafayette and Printemps Boat Ride. This gives the best magnificent view of Paris\rarchitectures Pantheon Bastille - Best hang out place lots of bars and food place a\rhappening place Moulin Rouge or Lido [Both French Cabarets] your choice ;) Tower Montparnasse Museums:\n Louvre - home of Monalisa Orsay - best place to go if you like impressionism artists like\rMonet/Gaugh etc. Rodin - Sculpture Picasso - the name say it all Outside Paris:\n Versailles Few Tips:\n Be aware of pickpockets and small thefts. Paris is a small City it is only 15KM by 10KM. Ask for a metro Map when you get here. It involves a lot of walking so get yourself a good pair of walking\rshoes. There are not many public toilets and you need to carry change\r[coins] to use them. Get yourself a phone card from \u0026ldquo;TABAC\u0026rdquo; [where you buy cigarettes]\rfor calling inside and outside France. There are special cards for\rIndia or US if you need any. Metro tickets you can buy the 10 tickets \u0026ldquo;carnet\u0026rdquo; or day pass\rdepending upon your travel plan. You can use the same on any other\rpublic transport as long as you with in Paris. Each Street corner will have road names and tells you which\rarrondisement you are in. **Getting a place to Stay/ Hotel:**It is expensive when it comes to\rhotel in Europe and Paris in particular. The rooms are small and\rexpensive. Personally I think if you get a hotel around Latin Quarter\rthat is 5th, 6th is best as you are close to city center and the\rlocality is nice. 7th, 8th are also good with 1st to 4th. Paris is very\rsafe city in general. I personally do not like the area around the big\rTrain stations of Gare de Nord and Gare del\u0026rsquo;Est The 18th,19th and 20th\rare should be avoided from my own prospective and you have happen to\rstay in 13th-16th make sure your hotel is not very far from Metro\rStation as these are more residential arrondisements with metro stations\rnot very close by like center of city.\n**Food:**Few lines about French food; if you do not take fish and a\rIndian vegetarian then there are not many choice for you L. Fish and Sea\rfood is very common in French cuisine; it is almost considered\rvegetarians some times. But the pastry, bakery products and chocolates\rare delicious I am not joking.But there are lots of Indian place to\rchoose from but make sure you ask for right amount of spices as it is\rvery scaled down for locals.\n","excerpt":"Me and Pamela are living in Paris for a while now and we are still\renjoying going around and exploring Paris.

Due to French\rtenant law, it is not legal for a landlord to kick you out during the 3\rmain months of winter. Thus you can stop paying and they can do nothing\r?till spring. In Paris landlords protect themselves by demanding a\rguarantor who will pay your rent if you default. To be eligible the\rguarantor must be on the French social security system. For most this is\ra parent.Foreigners can look to French friends, but beware, there is a\rbig stigma to this. Since it is generally your parents that do this,\rasking someone else suggests that your parents are poor. Generally\rpeople will be shocked to be asked.Another alternative is 1% lodgment.\r1% lodgment is really looked down on. Makes you seem poor.

So I told I am not going to move out from\rhotel if needed I will pay from my pocket and wait till the delivery of\rmy shipment from US is done. So after heated arguments they say oh!! No\rproblem how many days you want to stay more \u0026hellip;.Tuesday/Wednesday: I\rtook two days off from work. I think I should have given time off to get\rsettle in my apartment. Any way the movers came on time and really\rworked hard to make the delivery at 3rd floor without lift. I realized\rthe sofa is too.. big for my place and I still wonder how I am going to\rget rid of this big and heavy stuff. Lots of box to open and arrange and\rwe are trying our best. I must admit Pamela did a great job. In mean\rtime we went to get curtains and other needs from nearby stores.After,\rall these I still realize the weekends needs lots of work.Weekends,\rstarted with Darty - the Electronic super store here to order freeze,\rwashing machine etc and we ended up going to IKEA on Sunday for some\rsmall furnitures.\n","excerpt":"OK, we moved to our own apartment after all. This whole week was very\rbusy and hectic.Monday: It started with getting informed that my\rcheckout from hotel was the very same day. But I was not informed about\rthis before. And hotel people informed Pamela and disconnected\rtelephone; a real mess. We could not connect each other and convey what\rwas happening at two ends.

Next to it is high court of France.On\rthe way back to hotel we got down at Champs-Elysses Etoile. After\rwalking on that famous road we decided to climb all those 200+ circular\rsteps to go to the top of the Arc de Triomphe.
