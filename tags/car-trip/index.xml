darshan. May be god wanted me to experience the same. Few days back
Santanu suddenly decided to visit before his upcoming hectic weeks at
office. So it was kind of planned-unplanned trip. Why unplanned
knowingly was&amp;hellip;.we didn&amp;rsquo;t had any ticket in hands before starting the
journey nor we had any references to make use of.</description></item></channel></rss>
