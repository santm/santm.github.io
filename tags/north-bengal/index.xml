      <description>Siliguri is gateway to the North East of India. It is commercial city ofNorth Bengal where tea, timber and transport are the main business.It is a base point to head towards Darjeeling, Sikkim, kalimpong,mirik etc. Besides, it is also the transit point for air, road andrail traffic to the neighboring countries of Nepal, Bhutan andBangladesh.
Situated at foot of Eastern Himalayas it has very pleasant temperaturebut weather is very unpredictable as it gets shower any time.</description>

      <description>Well it has been a long time I bloged. I am back to Paris; Pamela willjoin me in a month time. The title of the post could not be better as Iam missing the sun after returning from India. I like rain after veryhot summer or sunny days with cool breeze. I really can not take thosedark cloudy days which makes me feel gloomy. As looking out of my windowcan&amp;rsquo;t even make out is it 11 AM or 3 PM.</description>
