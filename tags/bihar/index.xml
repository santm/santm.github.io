      <description>Reading old newspaper clipping fascinate me; an article which earns agood amount space on that day and most likely people read and forgot.and here I am reading it after days with a fresh eye. And most times itturns out to be a great story to read with eagerness.
This one was bit special which caught my eyes today was &amp;ldquo;ChaturananMishrapassed away&amp;rdquo;; now there are few things which made me to write this quickpost.</description>
