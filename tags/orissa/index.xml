      <description>We had to extend our planned holidays as wegot a last minute invitation for my cousin&amp;rsquo;s marriage now both marriageswere only 6 days apart. Personally was quite unhappy about the wholesituation of attending two marriages; instead of voicing opinions, keptcribbing and ranting. Confronting such family matters does not work asno one is right. Anyways, at times you are forced to go along with suchdecision whether you like it or not.</description>
