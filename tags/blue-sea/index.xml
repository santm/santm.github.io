      <description>Drive from Kanyankumari was smooth, Aarush took a small nap. The roadwas undivided two lanes so the speed was limited but the lush green frompaddy field , coconut grove and plantation leaves was pleasant for eyes.We reached Kovalam as per our plan, saw sunset which was magnificient.It was great to watch perfect sunrise and sunset on a same day. PublicBeach was next to Taj and Leela hotels where large part belongs to themfor their private beach.</description>
