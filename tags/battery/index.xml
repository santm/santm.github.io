battery died last year; nothing to complain about the same. We have used
it enough and did not have any complain. Only thing that happened is the
battery started to loose charge more often and at the end it stopped
charging altogether. Just after I got this I-Pod, Apple had to settle a
lawsuit for low
quality batteries. That way I must say I am happy to survive for 3 years
with one battery.</description></item></channel></rss>
