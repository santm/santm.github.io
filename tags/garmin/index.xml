upcoming Hyderabad run which I am trying to be a regular member.
Normally the &amp;ldquo;numero uno&amp;rdquo; destination for hill training around Bangalore
is Nandi Hill ; which is 60KM north of the city. Have already run Nandi
hills few times and yes Nandi is grueling specially the last 3 KM. Nandi
run is 15KM in total where you go 7.</description></item><item><title>Chennai DRHM</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2013-07-12-chennai-drhm/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2013 18:45:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2013-07-12-chennai-drhm/</guid><description>Chennai DRHM ( Dream Runners Half
Marathon) was on
1st Sunday of July i.e. 7thJuly 2013. It was the first run
out of Bangalore for me. Last time I registered for Mumbai Standard
Chartered was in 2008 and was gifted with Aarush just few days before
the race :D Well Aarush is the reason why I can not run on weekdays
morning but he is the catalyst who introduced me to The Pacemakers
running group of Bangalore.</description></item></channel></rss>
