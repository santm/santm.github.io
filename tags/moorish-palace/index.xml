There
can be 8,000 visitors inside Alhambra in a given day. Out of those 8,000
around 6,500 are sold over internet &amp;amp; phone. So for us, it meant getting
up early and queuing up in the morning. As it was Monday and not peak of
tourist season&amp;hellip; we were lucky.
Alhambra has main 4 sites to visit.
The main attraction is of course &amp;ldquo;Palacios Nazaries&amp;rdquo; the best preserved
Moorish Palace in Europe.</description></item></channel></rss>
