      <description>Just back from a week-long trip of Kerala. We left on a Monday quiteunusual day to start a trip, always there is something new to do. Weleft home at 4:10 AM and b&amp;rsquo;cos of that we had almost zero traffic incrossing Bangalore city and every toll both we did had any queue and by7:30 we reached Salem and stopped for Breakfast. Post breakfast we hadto cross Salem and by 12ish we are in the border of Tamil Nadu &amp;amp; Kerala.</description>

      <description>Our trip to South was one for which we hardly planned meticulously.Moreover, my son got fractured elbow but then also our spirit was onhigh although bit dampened that whether we will enjoy or not; kind ofexcitement mixed with anxiety, hope and happiness. I still remember themoment we sat in the car and started for the trip which was going to beone of the longest drive with Aarush.</description>

      <description>Around 10 we started for our next destination to Kottayam which wasaround 140K M away. From Varkala we started following the road signs forKochi but once we almost approached Kottayam/ Kumarakom we got littlebit lost but soon found our way towards Kottayam. Roads were good exceptlast part near GK Riverview homestay(Rough Guide recommendation). The owner of the homestay tried his bestto discourage from coming with a small kid which infact made us moredetermined to stay with him.</description>

      <description>Drive from Kanyankumari was smooth, Aarush took a small nap. The roadwas undivided two lanes so the speed was limited but the lush green frompaddy field , coconut grove and plantation leaves was pleasant for eyes.We reached Kovalam as per our plan, saw sunset which was magnificient.It was great to watch perfect sunrise and sunset on a same day. PublicBeach was next to Taj and Leela hotels where large part belongs to themfor their private beach.</description>
