Thanks to my
work; was awake from 3 AM and had no trouble of getting ready early on
Sunday. By 8:40 AM we reached; crowd just started to show-up there was
not much problem of parking and all. As soon after we entered the main
glass-house Aarush started to sneeze incessantly. Among many varieties
of flower main attraction was off course the huge structure of India
Gate made of roses; it was tribute to soldiers who lost their lives
during the Second World war.</description></item></channel></rss>
