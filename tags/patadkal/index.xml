      <description>Visiting the northern part of Karnataka for its historic and artisticmonuments were long due. We thought of doing it two years back during15th August long weekend but postponed the same due to late rain andhigh water level at Tungabhadra Rivers. This year we started to planearly and consulted two avid travelers and their guidance in setting upthe itinerary. It was planned that we would use the 2 weeks schoolvacation for this trip, but then I personally felt it would be a greatmiss Durga pooja twice in a row.</description>
