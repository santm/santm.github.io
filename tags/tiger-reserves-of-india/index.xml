has been such a long time that we posted something we almost forgot how
to type long paragraphs. Maybe all due to Facebook and WhatsApp which is
instant but then in when you look back you have no way to figure out
what all the noise was about. Well enough of rant now let me
type….*Beginning
of 2017 we were very much looking for a vacation and Pamela was
interested in Uttarakhand.</description></item><item><title>Masinagudi</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2012-09-14-masinagudi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Sep 2012 00:43:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2012-09-14-masinagudi/</guid><description>The long waited Summer Vacation of 2012 ; earlier we used to escape the
peak season madness now we are in the madness since both Aarush and
Pamela are now part of active school. And we are going to be like this
for years to come with no other choice. With that said, still wanted to
avoid the crowded destinations. We wanted to visit ‘ Nilgiris’ the
number uno summer destination of South India and picked Mudumalai,
Ooty(Red Hills) and Connoor.</description></item></channel></rss>
