      <description>I just found out d-atmosphere.com is holding a competition where theyare offering a free wordpress theme called WPRemix. Itâ€™s a very nice theme with loadsof features.
The rule is simple - just write about the competition in your blog andpost your link back in the comments on the contest page.
The winner will be announced on March 1st.</description>
