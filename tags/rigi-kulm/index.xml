      <description>Queen of Swiss Mountains From Zurich we went to Mt. Rigi via Arth-Goldau a very short train ride.From there we took the cogwheel train to the summit at Rigi-Kulm(1,800m). Incredible vistas, typical Swiss farmhouses, and hundreds ofcows with bells will surprise one throughout the trip. Reward on goingto top is magnificent panorama of Alpine peaks crowding around theconvoluted contours of Lake Lucerne. While going up it was a niceweather but slowly &amp;amp; slowly it started getting dark.</description>
