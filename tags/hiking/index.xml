Had breakfast and
left the hotel around 9 AM. There are some journeys in life which are
hard to forget. Our trek to the much talked about Double Decker Root
Bridge was one such journey for me. Staying at Cheerapunji holiday
resort has one advantage that it is hardly 7 km away from double-decker
root bridge. We went 5 KMÂ till Tyrna village where we parked our car and
then 3KMs of hiking we were told by hotel people.</description></item></channel></rss>
