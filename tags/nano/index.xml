we found very practical and perfect for our Indian need. And we did not
thought of booking any new car in recent time. Suddenly things got
changed when Pamela started a new job in May. We were quite happy with
single car and personally opted for BIAS (Bangalore International
Airport - Volvo) as I commute from Hebbal to Old Airport read every day
around 20KM one way.</description></item></channel></rss>
