      <description>May 17- June 16
By 5th month slowly started introducing solid food like banana andapple puree to Aarush. According to our custom till&amp;ldquo;Annaprasanna&amp;rdquo;we are not suppose to introduce solid food like rice or wheat to baby.And his didu was also against using common baby food item like &amp;ldquo;Cerelac&amp;rdquo;as they contain rice or wheat. This resulted in his first solid bitebeing fruit &amp;ndash; mashed banana. The first spoon he swallowed as my momfed him, but little man has a frown of disapproval, like &amp;ldquo;what the heckthey are feeding me?</description>
