Last month was quite hectic
as we celebrated Aarush&amp;rsquo;s first birthday
We started planning from December onwards. As our schedule now revolves
around his nap-time and whims we hardly get time for each other or to
discuss any matter itâ€™s just a lot more rare these days than it used to
be. So, gone are the days of last minute plan. Despite how he has
completely turned our lives upside down we wanted to celebrate his first
b&amp;rsquo;day which I know he hardly will acknowledge at this age.</description></item></channel></rss>
