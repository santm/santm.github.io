      <description>Monsoon is about to end. So begins the celebrations and festivals acrossIndia. Any Indian festival is incomplete without the typical Indianfestivities, the gatherings, celebrations, exchange of sweets and gifts,lots of noise, singing and dancing. Festivals are the celebration ofnot only togetherness but also being part of the family.
In India, monsoon follows FIFO (first in first out) model so thefestivals. As the fields look brilliant with a bountiful harvest; thebeautiful landscape of greenery can be seen in its full radiance at thistime.</description>
