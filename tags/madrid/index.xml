were at the very last phase of our vacation. We took train back to
Madrid tonight as from there we had our flight back to Paris.
We booked the train ticket long back; I went in-person to get the same
from Spanish Railway ticket office based in Paris. The office is kind of
hidden by all the stores near to Boulevard Haussmann; ever busy shopping
place.
Being Indian it was a really something new although we had experienced
few other different night trains in Europe.</description></item><item><title>Madrid - Spain</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2005-05-21-madrid-spain/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 May 2005 18:16:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2005-05-21-madrid-spain/</guid><description>We were on our way to spring break; we planned to visit Spain and Lisbon
for 10 days. We started our trip with flight from Paris to Madrid on
Saturday 21st May 2005.
We reached Charles de Gaulle Airport on time and the checking was smooth
but after boarding the plane we were in ground for almost one hour
before taking off. The cost cutting measures with European state
carriers are all alike now, so there is no free snacks &amp;amp; drinks in the
short flight.</description></item></channel></rss>
