take for year 2008 - this gave us 9 days off with two weekends. I
preferred a week before Christmas to avoid traffic and tourist.
Initial plan was to leave Bangalore on Sunday for Mysore and move
from there depending on Aarush&amp;rsquo;s comfort. Stepping out of the home with
him means a disrupted routine and adapting to a new environment for all
us.</description></item></channel></rss>
