      <description>Our trip to SouthÂ was one for which we hardly planned meticulously.Moreover, my son got fractured elbow but then also our spirit was onhigh although bit dampened that whether we will enjoy or not; kind ofexcitement mixed with anxiety, hope and happiness. I still remember themoment we sat in the car and started for the trip which was going to beone of the longest drive with Aarush.</description>

      <description>After being guest of GK Homestay for 2 nights at 7.00 we hit the roadtowards Malampuzha. It is about 8 km from the Palakkad town; Palkad isknown as gateway between Tamilnadu and Kerala as it is a valley betweenhills. It is major rice growing area and home of many Tamil Brahmins whoare living in Kerala for centuries.
Malampuzha Garden is build next to reservoir on river with same name.</description>
