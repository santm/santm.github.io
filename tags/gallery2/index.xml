      <description>Gallery 3 isgoing to a big change from current gallery 2 and initial alpha releasedid not have any migration path from gallery2. It was pushed to Betarelease after 2 alpha releases. but to my surprise I found it wasimplemented in alpha 4 and here is the test result of a new neat code. Iam really liking the new compact code making gallery 3 faster and leancompared to its predecessor.</description>
