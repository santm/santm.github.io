door code of our apartment where using a scroll buttons one has to
search and select the name and then press “appel” means “call”
button which will give a ring to the concerned persons apartment and it
is that habitué who will answer that call &amp;amp; unlock the main door.
Certain buildings will have only code with rarely names on front doors
so without “Le code” you won&amp;rsquo;t get past the outer door which usually
leads to a small inner courtyard or a stairway.</description></item></channel></rss>
