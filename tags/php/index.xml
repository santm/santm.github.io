When digital camera came out with decent mega pixel was an early adapter
of the same. But soon realized sharing Pictures on email was not an
option and hosted pictures on Tripod. Oh! they used to give 10MB of
free hosting :) now Flicker gives one 1TB free. So long story small
after the managing own gallyery app writen initally with csv and php ,
later mysql and php and lastly Gallery for almost 10 years.</description></item><item><title>Gallerry 3 sneak peak</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2009-05-08-gallerry-3-sneak-peak/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 May 2009 16:03:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2009-05-08-gallerry-3-sneak-peak/</guid><description>Gallery 3 is
going to a big change from current gallery 2 and initial alpha release
did not have any migration path from gallery2. It was pushed to Beta
release after 2 alpha releases. but to my surprise I found it was
implemented in alpha 4 and here is the test result of a new neat code. I
am really liking the new compact code making gallery 3 faster and lean
compared to its predecessor.</description></item><item><title>create typewriter effect with ming php for flash (swf) movie</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2005-11-25-create-typewriter-effect-with-ming-php-for-flash-swf-movie/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Nov 2005 11:46:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2005-11-25-create-typewriter-effect-with-ming-php-for-flash-swf-movie/</guid><description>This is nice and simple code it creates the simple effect which you
might have seen in lots of web sites. As it is PHP you can use the same
from your own news reader to database.
setBackground(0x00,0x00,0x00);// SM
This is very important as it set sets the speed of the movie// SM -
Higher the number faster the typing will
appear$movie-&amp;gt;setRate(3);// SM - This one will depends upon
you$movie-&amp;gt;setDimension(600,40);$movie-&amp;gt;setFrames(31);$movie-&amp;gt;nextFrame();//
Define your String here $str = &amp;lsquo;Miing Typewriter Effect&amp;rsquo;; /* SM - As
you note The space between character if not fixed SM - due to font
width so you have to figure out your own SM - Now we split our string
and make an array with the same */ $chars = preg_split('//', $str,
-1, PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY);// print_r($chars);$inc = 0
;for($i=0;$isetFont($myFont); $myText-&amp;gt;setColor(255,255,255);
$myText-&amp;gt;SetHeight(30); $myText-&amp;gt;addString($chars[$i]); echo

$firstText-&amp;gt;moveTo($inc,30); $inc = $inc + 18; // SM - this is very
critical as you need to add this extra frame to make this effect of
some typewriter $movie-&amp;gt;nextframe(); // SM - This helps to
determine the width of the movie // SM - turn only if you need the
same // echo &amp;ldquo;inc is $inc \n&amp;rdquo; ; } // SM - we do not want to loop this
movie// $movie-&amp;gt;add(new SWFAction(&amp;ldquo;stop();&amp;quot;)); // SM - Save the
