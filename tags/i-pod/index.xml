      <description>Our old faithful I-podâ€™sbattery died last year; nothing to complain about the same. We have usedit enough and did not have any complain. Only thing that happened is thebattery started to loose charge more often and at the end it stoppedcharging altogether. Just after I got this I-Pod, Apple had to settle alawsuit for lowquality batteries. That way I must say I am happy to survive for 3 yearswith one battery.</description>

      <description>Requested my brother to send me one I-pod from USA with Hitesh as he wascoming to Paris on a business trip. It was very nice to catch up withHitesh, Neetu and Simran after moving out of CA. We met them at theirhotel in Latin quarter and had dinner with them. It was almost 2 in themorning when we returned home in the cold night of February.</description>
