      <description>Saturday, we planned for Sentosa Island – Sentosa is the top touristattraction if you ask any Singaporean tourist information or locals.Sentosa has it all – beach, corporate team building activities,aquarium, great food and entertainment and soon there will be Casio andentertainment park with roller coaster rides. We planned for completeday-trip; as usual after heavy breakfast we went by metro to HarbourFront MRT station. From there took Sentosa Express (Monorail train)from Vivocity mall’s top floor.</description>

      <description>Next day, when we woke up, were very happy to see blue sky after twodays of grey sky. Around 9.00 AM we came by boat to hot-spot St. Mark&amp;rsquo;sSquare. St. Mark&amp;rsquo;s Basilica which is Byzantine influenced was toocrowded to visit that time and unfortunately in evening we ran out oftime and could not make it so satisfied ourselves from outside only.Doge&amp;rsquo;s Palace is a gothic palace with bridge of sighs at rear endwhich is made of white limestone and has windows with stone bars.</description>

      <description>We got up early had a quick breakfast and dragged our bags to MilanCentral Station; bought our ticket for next destination“Cinqueterre” - refers to five small villages (Corniglia,Manarola, Monterosso al Mare, Riomaggiore and Vernazza) - cling tothe rugged mountains along Mediterranean coastline with breath takingview.
This UNSECO heritage site is not on the main train line or motor-waythat connects Milan to Rome. To get there, we have to cross the mountainto reach the western side of Italy.</description>

Last day, woke up very early in the morning to visit Candolim, Sinquerimbeach- Just to avoid scorching heat of sun. The shimmering sea stretchesto the horizon. Spent some time to savour the view then headed to FortAguada. Fort Agauda crowns the rocky flattened headland at the end ofthe beach. Constructed in 1612 to protect the northern shores of Mandoviestuary from Dutch and Maratha raiders. It was a reference point for thevessels coming from Europe at that time.</description>

      <description>As we couldn’t enjoy much earlier day we decided to opt for rented bikeand move around in our own pace. Rented a bike for 2 days for 400Rupees. One thing which is very interesting about Goa’s motorcycle taxilocally known as pilots ideal for nipping between beaches or forshort distances. Bonafide operators ride black bikes with yellowmudguards and white number plate. These vehicles transport a singlepillion rider.</description>

      <description>We opted for package tour with our hotel stay, so our hotel had arrangedfor two day sightseeing South Goa with river cruise and North Goa. Weopted for South Goa to start with.

Old Goa churches-Bom Jesus Basilicaand se cathedral along with two temples Mangueshi and shantadurgadedicated to Shiva and shantadurga (goddess of Peace), visit toAncestral Goa/old Portuguese house and Colva beach.</description>

      <description>In Goa, traveling around by rented motorcycle or car is imperativeif you want more than just sun, surf and sand. It gives lot of freedombut can be perilous at same time. On second day early morning we haggledat least with three owners for renting and lastly ended up with Activafor Rupees 250(it is better to rent for long durations to get goodprice). Another reason for renting was we wanted to go to Bicholim tovisit Santanu’s maternal uncle for dinner.</description>

      <description>Trip to Goa was long due may-be you can say from 2001 when I gotopportunity as a teacher with my school children. But unfortunately, Icouldn’t make as I was supposed to behave as good girl. Good unmarriedIndian girls don’t go anywhere without an escort. To qualify as anescort there are lots of criteria to be checked and considered likefriend’s brother, acquaintance from neighborhood etc. is a BIG NO.</description>

      <description>After moving from Paris, we had been planning to take a trip somewhereout of Mumbai. We even bought a Travel book on India to explore more ourown motherland. But with time and circumstances our plan didn’t gotexecuted. At last, after longtime we took a day break on last weekendwhen Santanu came to know at last moment about his holiday on MahaShivratri. Since it was last moment plan we could only make for onenight stay.</description>

      <description>Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia, located on the north-east coast ofSpain. City is well connected with five metro lines other then publictransports like city railway and buses.
We started for Barcelona on early morning of Feb.28. It?s a city withcharming streets, busy with people and full of life. There is nowherebetter to make Barcelona&amp;rsquo;s acquaintance than La Rambla, the bustlingavenue, famous for the vivid colors of its flower stalls ?</description>
