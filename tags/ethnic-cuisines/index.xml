      <description>Singapore has so many ethnic cuisines to offer for its nativesthat you have to stay long to explore all the corners. Food is highlyinfluenced by Malaysian, Chinese, Indonesian and none other but SouthIndian too. Even annually Singapore government organizes “SingaporeFood Festival” in month of July. I was lucky enough to get a glimpseof it. When it is a matter of food I consider myself to be “not atypical desi” sticking only to one variety of food.</description>
