      <description>By now, seeing the time I wasdiscussing about hitch hiking to the next big town which was ruled outby Santanu as it seems not safe. Even I was suggesting him how aboutgetting into a car of people who does not look that young and suddenlyone car stopped and they asked if we need any lift… looking at theirface we did not take a second to decide and say “YES” in unison (whichcame out as if instinct) with big smiling face.</description>

      <description>Till we are not sure what would be our next destination for today. Thenearest attraction is Montreaux, but that being so close to Lausanne wewere discussing to keep it for last day. After taking a hearty breakfastwe reached railway station. We asked at the information desk about theSwiss travel pass and Post Bus.
Traveling with yellow Swiss post bus system is really breath takingexperience as they connect any place in Switzerland which can’t bereached by train.</description>
