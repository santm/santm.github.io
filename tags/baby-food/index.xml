After rice ceremony at Siliguri we finally came to Bangalore. This time
he was fine both in train and plane. We stayed in service apartment for
3 nights till our things moved to our rented apartment.
Too many changes of weather, locations and little less careÂ Aarush got
high fever for the first time and we had to rush him to Manipal. When it
settled we started to strolled within our apartment complex to know our
neighborhood more.</description></item><item><title>Fifth Month</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2009-05-15-fifth-month/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2009 05:12:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2009-05-15-fifth-month/</guid><description>May 17- June 16
By 5th month slowly started introducing solid food like banana and
apple puree to Aarush. According to our custom till
&amp;ldquo;Annaprasanna&amp;rdquo;
we are not suppose to introduce solid food like rice or wheat to baby.
And his didu was also against using common baby food item like &amp;ldquo;Cerelac&amp;rdquo;
as they contain rice or wheat. This resulted in his first solid bite
being fruit &amp;ndash; mashed banana. The first spoon he swallowed as my mom
fed him, but little man has a frown of disapproval, like &amp;ldquo;what the heck
they are feeding me?</description></item></channel></rss>
