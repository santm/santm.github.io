      <description>Pre-Race Day 
The day started early, we get out Cochin Club today and part our ourways for some time. While Pamela &amp;amp; Aarush goes back to Bangalore onSaturday itself I stay back for the big run on Sunday.
They had a train to catch around 9 from ERS. There was not a single autoaround so had to walk and get one from Ferry station and as usual theprice asked and agreed is way more than normal,</description>

      <description>Our trip to South was one for which we hardly planned meticulously.Moreover, my son got fractured elbow but then also our spirit was onhigh although bit dampened that whether we will enjoy or not; kind ofexcitement mixed with anxiety, hope and happiness. I still remember themoment we sat in the car and started for the trip which was going to beone of the longest drive with Aarush.</description>

      <description>After being guest of GK Homestay for 2 nights at 7.00 we hit the roadtowards Malampuzha. It is about 8 km from the Palakkad town; Palkad isknown as gateway between Tamilnadu and Kerala as it is a valley betweenhills. It is major rice growing area and home of many Tamil Brahmins whoare living in Kerala for centuries.
Malampuzha Garden is build next to reservoir on river with same name.</description>

      <description>Around 10 we started for our next destination to Kottayam which wasaround 140K M away. From Varkala we started following the road signs forKochi but once we almost approached Kottayam/ Kumarakom we got littlebit lost but soon found our way towards Kottayam. Roads were good exceptlast part near GK Riverview homestay(Rough Guide recommendation). The owner of the homestay tried his bestto discourage from coming with a small kid which infact made us moredetermined to stay with him.</description>

      <description>Drive from Kanyankumari was smooth, Aarush took a small nap. The roadwas undivided two lanes so the speed was limited but the lush green frompaddy field , coconut grove and plantation leaves was pleasant for eyes.We reached Kovalam as per our plan, saw sunset which was magnificient.It was great to watch perfect sunrise and sunset on a same day. PublicBeach was next to Taj and Leela hotels where large part belongs to themfor their private beach.</description>

      <description>It was the first long weekend of Independence day of 2011 after Pamelahad joined her job. We were very keen to get away from Bangalore as lasttime it was March when we went toChickbelapur.Initial plan was to visit Hampi; but after talking to few homestayaround we decided against it as that part of Karnataka was expecting toget unusual amount of rain and flood could be any time.</description>

      <description>On second day we went to see Lakidi view point, Phookot lake andVythiri resort. Lakidi is about 2 km south of Chain Tree and is thegateway of Wayanad which is on highway to Calicut. It is a ghat pass atan elevation of 700m above sea level.We crossed Kalpetta and drovemostly on NH 212.

Overwhelmed with scenery as this highway is heaven on this earth , abeautiful place with lot of tea gardens on the way.</description>

      <description>After a deep slumber the next morning we woke-up fresh and energetic.Aarush wanted to play seeing an open space- courtyard. They have toys,cycles, carom board, badminton court, balls to play with. He was reallyhappy to get all these stuffs. What more parent wants if kid is happyyou are happy otherwise nothing on earth can make you happy.
Morning, we were shown all rooms available there. It was a nice roomwith a central common area and one room each on either side.</description>

      <description>From the time Santanu having classes and top of it exams this month; itsreally a grueling month for both of us. For this I too was not gettingsome time off from “Our little one”. There was absolute need of onebreak. Santanu suddenly said two days before last exam that he is havingleave and if interested then we can go somewhere near by. Then he onlystarted reading on net and ended up saying we would go toWAYANAD- Northern region of Kerala.</description>
