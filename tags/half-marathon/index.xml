Mahabaleshwar located
in western ghat. PaceMakers decided to run this HM instead of Hyderabad
beginning of the year and booked a complete hotel in February itself.
That caused a uproar in Indian armature running community. The
registration for Satara HM for out station also got closed as there is a
limited hotel accommodation in this town. Personally I was not very
keen to run to it given the remote location and no direct train and
flight.</description></item><item><title>Chennai DRHM</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2013-07-12-chennai-drhm/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2013 18:45:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2013-07-12-chennai-drhm/</guid><description>Chennai DRHM ( Dream Runners Half
Marathon) was on
1st Sunday of July i.e. 7thJuly 2013. It was the first run
out of Bangalore for me. Last time I registered for Mumbai Standard
Chartered was in 2008 and was gifted with Aarush just few days before
the race :D Well Aarush is the reason why I can not run on weekdays
morning but he is the catalyst who introduced me to The Pacemakers
running group of Bangalore.</description></item></channel></rss>
