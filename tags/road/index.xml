      <description>As we are new to Bangalore trying to explore all nearby hypermarket,supermarket and open markets as we settle in. This is also giving us aschance to explore places around. The first one we tried and explored wasBIG-BAZAR on Old Madras road. As it is just near to one of ouroffice address in Bangalore I knew how to reach there without beinglost. Then weekend after we tried SPAR at Kormongala followed byNilgiris.</description>

      <description>“Shiv jayanti” should not be confused with Shivratri (Night oflord Shiva)- marked with devotion to one of most powerful lord in Hindumythology. While Shiv jayanti (Birthday) is celebration of birthanniversary of Shivaji Maharaj who ruled Maratha region in 17thcentury fighting against powerful Mughal Empire of North-India. He wasnamed Shiva, after the local Goddess Shivai, to whom his mother Jijabaihad prayed for a son.</description>

      <description>Every time I visit my in-laws and see one of these “Bhat Suar”(three-wheeler cart) on the road it brings back memories of my collegedays. Durg(in-law’s place) and Bhopal(college day) were part of samestate 6 years back; although politically divided they are very similarto an outsider like me on social and geographical terms.
First part of the name comes from the sound they make “Bhat-Bhat”and second part “suar which means pig”.</description>

      <description>Freshened up to kick start our day and decided to go through past ofGermany. Took metro and got off at Potsdamer platz. Had coffee atStarbucks just outside the metro exit as it was too cold.
From here we walked to Checkpoint Charlie - a crossing point betweenEast and West Germany during the Cold War and Berlin Wall Memorial.The scenes blur as present dissolves into the past. Images flash throughour mind of 1989 when news flashed with headlines of demolition ofBerlin wall.</description>

      <description>There are plenty of places to explore in Tuscan region from Florence asday trip. We decided to visit Siena which is only one hour. Reasonfor choosing Siena was for its medieval beauty; in that era Siena andFlorence were at war when Florence defeated Siena.
Travel by road through Tuscan region is really amazing as you crossthose post-card hills. But exhausted from yesterdays walking on thecobble stone roads of Florence I dozed as soon we hit the highway thatmade Santanu bit furious as he couldn’t share those moments.</description>

      <description>Being exhausted from last evening we got up bit late and had very goodbreakfast before hitting the road. According to our itinerary, distanceto be covered was long one as our hotel was booked at Florence.
We took train to La Spezia, it was a crowded, got packed with eachpassing stations of Cinque Terre but became empty as soon as wecrossed Riomaggiore. We had to wait a bit at La Spezia as train wascoming from north was late.</description>

      <description>** Prologue:**
Weeklong journey ofItaly takes us backto summer of 2004; due to various reasons never posted travelogues ontime though pictures from the same were published on time. Please hangon as we try to recite detailed vacation from our faithful memory.
We had a night train from Bercy Station, Paris. For us, reaching Bercywas bit far from our Metro Station (Exelmans on M9) as there was no easyinterchange; while on street-road map it looks closer from ourapartment.</description>

A day when old and young indulge in royal feast on thisfestival of snacks and sweet.</description>

      <description>Black and yellow metered taxi’s made famous by Bollywood movies playa major role of public transport in Mumbai other then auto rickshaws,trains and buses. In New York they are yellow, in London they areBlack and in Mumbai they’re both yellow and black. They are part ofMumbai heritage. Normally, they move in snail space at peak hours whichmay depend on the area traversed and the state of the roads.</description>

      <description>Monsoon is about to end. So begins the celebrations and festivals acrossIndia. Any Indian festival is incomplete without the typical Indianfestivities, the gatherings, celebrations, exchange of sweets and gifts,lots of noise, singing and dancing. Festivals are the celebration ofnot only togetherness but also being part of the family.
In India, monsoon follows FIFO (first in first out) model so thefestivals. As the fields look brilliant with a bountiful harvest; thebeautiful landscape of greenery can be seen in its full radiance at thistime.</description>

Based on his stealing efforts there is a very popular ceremony calleddahi-handi celebrated with lot of enthusiasm and glee on this day oron the second day of Janmashtami.</description>

      <description>It is a celebration of unconditional love between brother and sister inHindu culture. This age old celebration tries to remind us of thebeautiful and unique relationship between brother and sister celebratedsince time immemorial. Sisters tie sacred threads on brothers wristasking for longer &amp;amp; healthy life of brother and brothers in-turn vow toprotect (to save her- Raksha) their sisters from any unpleasantsituations of life on this day.</description>

      <description>A four letter word of our modern consumerism; like all other 4 letterswords this is very commonly used.
The first time I was introduced to this was back in USA on Labor Dayweekend (1st week of September-’98). In US, every long weekendbrings a SALE. Size of weekend supplement of news-paper increaseswith advertisement from cars to toys. Not only that even you getconstant reminder from Macy’s to Wal-mart on your radio while you driveyour car.</description>

      <description>Looking at those plastic chairs brought back my memories ofAnandamela (a Bengalichildren magazine - published fortnight. They used to have picture ofcommon objects in obscure way and you have to identify the same. I knowthis picture is a far cry from those -any way some sweet memories toreflect upon from fourth floor while taking this picture.
In India celebration is part of life whether big or small ones.</description>

      <description>While coming to work this morning oxen (castrated male) cartcarrying sugar canes caught my attention. It is not a common site to seea bullock cart or hand pulled cart (pulled or pushed by a man) at theheart of Mumbai city next to VT Station.
They are not allowed in the main roads of the city but can only move inthe peripheral roads of the city. These kinds of slow moving objectscause most notorious traffic jam in India.</description>

      <description>Cricket – is India’s gorgeous past time – it is not taken as a sport.This picture was taken during Cricket World Cup of 2007 inside aMumbai cab. But somehow I never posted the same. I am not a big cricketfan but is impossible to avoid cricket while you are in India.
In recent time, performance of Indian cricket team is quitedisappointing. But that does not change Indians breathing cricket - beat India or abroad.</description>

      <description>Calcutta (Kolkata) – mega city of Eastern India. In this vibrantcity with a distinct socio-political culture, cabs are grand oldAmbassadors from Hindustan Motors and most of cars are manufacturedfrom the nearby plant of Uttarpara. This picture was taken next to majorlong distance Sealdah Railway Station which shows that city of joystill struggles with traffic congestion. Unlike of other major citieswhere Tata indica or fiat or Maruti are common hired forms of mechanisedtransport this city has almost all taxis as amby painted in yellow.</description>

It is commercial city ofNorth Bengal where tea, timber and transport are the main business.It is a base point to head towards Darjeeling, Sikkim, kalimpong,mirik etc. Besides, it is also the transit point for air, road andrail traffic to the neighboring countries of Nepal, Bhutan andBangladesh.

      <description>In India, life of middle class is different compared to occidentalculture. There is a vast population of middle class in India and withinmiddle class there are three distinct sub-divisions - “lowermiddleclass”, “middle middleclass” and “higher middleclass”.Comprehending the complexities of Indian society is not that easy.Though there are variations in socio-economic life within these threebut one thing is common between all of them - everyone is curious toknow whatz happening in others life despite of their own busy life.</description>

Last day, woke up very early in the morning to visit Candolim, Sinquerimbeach- Just to avoid scorching heat of sun. The shimmering sea stretchesto the horizon. Spent some time to savour the view then headed to FortAguada. Fort Agauda crowns the rocky flattened headland at the end ofthe beach. Constructed in 1612 to protect the northern shores of Mandoviestuary from Dutch and Maratha raiders. It was a reference point for thevessels coming from Europe at that time.</description>

      <description>As we couldn’t enjoy much earlier day we decided to opt for rented bikeand move around in our own pace. Rented a bike for 2 days for 400Rupees. One thing which is very interesting about Goa’s motorcycle taxilocally known as pilots ideal for nipping between beaches or forshort distances. Bonafide operators ride black bikes with yellowmudguards and white number plate. These vehicles transport a singlepillion rider.</description>

      <description>In Goa, traveling around by rented motorcycle or car is imperativeif you want more than just sun, surf and sand. It gives lot of freedombut can be perilous at same time. On second day early morning we haggledat least with three owners for renting and lastly ended up with Activafor Rupees 250(it is better to rent for long durations to get goodprice). Another reason for renting was we wanted to go to Bicholim tovisit Santanu’s maternal uncle for dinner.</description>

We booked our returnbus trip and were asked for shared taxi at 175 Rs for Mahabaleshwardarshan which we accepted.</description>

Our reportingtime was 00:15AM at Kharghar node but we were quite early then ourreporting time 11:30 PM fearing we might not get a public transport toreach on time. We waited for our bus and waited, and waited and waitedsome more. It was about 00:30AM and there was still no sign of our bus.</description>

But with time and circumstances our plan didn’t gotexecuted. At last, after longtime we took a day break on last weekendwhen Santanu came to know at last moment about his holiday on MahaShivratri. Since it was last moment plan we could only make for onenight stay.</description>

New in gallery - bibs from running . Well you must be wondering what isthat ? For a person like me from whom the activity of sport was takenaway by various pressures at young age it means a lot. The good side ofit is that I am the very few fortunate one to run at this age at variousplaces but rest remains as silent voice in vast population of India.</description>

      <description>By now, seeing the time I wasdiscussing about hitch hiking to the next big town which was ruled outby Santanu as it seems not safe. Even I was suggesting him how aboutgetting into a car of people who does not look that young and suddenlyone car stopped and they asked if we need any lift… looking at theirface we did not take a second to decide and say “YES” in unison (whichcame out as if instinct) with big smiling face.</description>

      <description>Till we are not sure what would be our next destination for today. Thenearest attraction is Montreaux, but that being so close to Lausanne wewere discussing to keep it for last day. After taking a hearty breakfastwe reached railway station. We asked at the information desk about theSwiss travel pass and Post Bus.
Traveling with yellow Swiss post bus system is really breath takingexperience as they connect any place in Switzerland which can’t bereached by train.</description>

      <description>After traveling to so many places in Europe in last three years now wewere thinking to travel to some other part of globe which can be easilyreached from Paris within few hours maybe somewhere in North African.The very thought came was how about going to Morocco or Egypt but noneof them was perfect weather wise to visit. Then also after too much ofthinking we settled for Morocco and started to gather touristicinformation.</description>

      <description>My current home in India is Siliguri, north of West Bengal may notbe the most alluring for tourist destinations. But it is the mostimportant city in the entire Eastern Himalayas due to its geographicallocation. As city is unabashedly an industrial centre and gateway toseven sisters of North-East along with Sikkim &amp;amp; eastern part of Nepal.My parents moved here ten years back and by that time I had just startedmy career; never had ample holidays to explore any thing around.</description>

For quite a while was thinking to write about 2005 year diary.Hmm&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;not able to write with this dull and grey sky and no needto mention the cold at Paris but wait&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip; seems some ray oflight is trying to reach my desk which I do not want to loose, hope thatwill keep my spirit high while writing this.</description>

      <description>Living in Paris and not travelling in Metro has lots of demerits. Likeusual I am going to start with the traffic jams, one way roads,unavailability of parking, high parking tickets and very unusual senseof Parisian driving skills.
These only list if you have a car and travelling of your own. But whatabout those who are taking other mode of smart transports like Bus,Tram, Bicycle, Rollerblade or just walk to work or work from home?</description>

      <description>Well the over night bus journey between Seville and Lisbon was not verylong one. We had an hour long stop as soon as we entered Portugal. Theroad condition was good and we reached the Oriental Stop of Lisbon atvery early hours and the sky was still dark. From there it took another20 minutes or so to reach the final destination near Zoological Garden.We took a taxi and the ride was a short one to our hotel for only 6Euros.</description>

      <description>Last day at Seville&amp;hellip; After checking out from the hotel we took abus and got down next to the Casino of Exposition. But today it is apublic holiday at Seville which we did not knew, so the roads were quiteempty at 9 in the morning. After getting down from the bus we walkedtowards Plaza de Espana. Plaza de Espana was built for 1929 world expo.Lots of Latin American countries joined that expo.</description>

      <description>Ishould have started jotting down all my memories from this beautifulcity immediately after my return to Paris. But back to work and dailyroutine&amp;hellip;. lots of finer moments are fading off.
We took a morning bus from Granada to Seville; we reached Seville around11AM. The bus ride was around 2 hours and 45 minutes. From thatIntercityBus stop to our hotel (again Novotel) we took again localpublic bus.</description>

      <description>The temperature in Spain was quite hot compared to Paris. It was around37° C when we reached Granada in the afternoon. The bus station forintercity is not at the city center but there is a good connection ofpublic transport for the same. Our hotel was at the center - PlazaRoyal.
Around 5 PM, we headed out from hotel, it was still very hot and bright.We walked towards Plaza Nueva.</description>

      <description>We have been thinking to visit South of France for a long time. Writingthe dairy for this trip is very unique as it had so many vivid eventsone after another. We took a packaged deal with one of the travel agency(Hotel and Bus with Sleeping-Berth)
After the event-full after-noon at Cite Perfecture we started at 9 P.Mfrom Paris. It was not a bad start till the first stop.</description>

      <description>Seeing one of friend&amp;rsquo;s photographs we were so excited to visit thatplace. That, in our last trip to Amsterdam (May 2003) we tried to visitthat - but alas! Local people told us that Tulip season is already over.But deep down in our heart we wanted to visit that place particularlyKeukenhof thinking -maybe next year.
Then we were in touch with Holland tourism in-order to know more aboutKeukenhof.</description>

      <description>Back to Paris after a nice and quick vacation of 4 weeks from India. Thedays passed by very quickly between meals and sleep. Our vacation gotsplit between my parents and in-law&amp;rsquo;s house. But it was great to spenttime with family. Will post some new pictures and others later. Paris isvery beautifully decorated for holidays, it is a great sight to see allthose big trees along the road being lighted up, as they don&amp;rsquo;t have anyleaf now.</description>

      <description>We wanted to visit all the top attractions of Italy in one trip but dueto vacation time (for Parisians) and taking off from work and withPamela&amp;rsquo;s school we could not do. So, we planned for only Rome. Weflew with Alitalia from CDG this time in early morning. It was muchbetter than Ryan Airlines in terms of access to the airport. But theinitial fun started when just before checking-in we have to run 3terminals to collect our tickets from Air Traffic office.</description>

      <description>Another nice weekend in the month of March and we are trying to see allthe top sights on our guidebook. We must admit this book is indeed avery good and very nice gift from Akiko and others. A highly recommendedguidebook on Paris by Avant Guide.This time we started with St.Chappell at Heart of Paris. Wonderful craftsmanship on glass windows,which tells the story of Bible. Next to it is high court of France.</description>
