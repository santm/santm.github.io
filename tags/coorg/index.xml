      <description>As we learn more about birds we try to accommodate a day or two withinour family trips for birding. These pictures were taken around Virajpet(South Coorg) and few within Nagarhole National Park. from our recenttrip in 2108 October.
The birds found here are very common to birds of Kerala as they are veryclose by.</description>

      <description>So just before school reopens we had out of Bangalore for 2 nights. Weopted for something closer to home Coorg but on the southern side. Weopted for this side as we been to more popular side near Madikeri in2008 when Aarush was around 9 month old. Time do really fly.
We started at 8:30 from home, very late compared to our slandered butthat day had Bangalore TCS 10K.</description>

      <description>My addiction to coffee is old an old one. My morning does not startwithout coffee on weekdays. I am not quite human still have mymorning coffee will probably describe it best. In India coffee is verydifferent from West. I came to know recently that Indian Coffee Boardis head quartered in Bangalore. The main coffee producing region ofIndia(hills of Coorg, Niligiris and Wayanad&amp;gt;) are not very far offBangalore.</description>

      <description>(&amp;hellip;.Continued&amp;hellip;)Next day we woke up leisurely had a wonderful breakfast . Our hostmeticulously wrote down all the attractions near Madikeri. The listincluded Tala-Cauvery – birth place of river Kaveri, Raja seat,Abby Falls, Omkareshwara Temple, Cauvery- Nisargadhama. Wedecided for all except the last one as we wanted to take it easy and notrushing between attractions.
As soon as we started driving to Madikeri (district headquarters ofCoorg) the real beauty of Coorg started to unveil itself.</description>
