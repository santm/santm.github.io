      <description>Wewere at the very last phase of our vacation. We took train back toMadrid tonight as from there we had our flight back to Paris.
We booked the train ticket long back; I went in-person to get the samefrom Spanish Railway ticket office based in Paris. The office is kind ofhidden by all the stores near to Boulevard Haussmann; ever busy shoppingplace.
Being Indian it was a really something new although we had experiencedfew other different night trains in Europe.</description>
