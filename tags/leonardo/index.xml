      <description>Time to say Ciao, a presto (bye, see u soon) to Venice!!! Althoughwe knew it might never be soon again. With a happy mood, we left forMilan from where we started our memorable journey. We boarded Euro-starfor which we had to make an advance reservation. Indisputably it was thebest train we boarded in last seven days. On reaching Milan kept ourluggage in lock room and set off to explore the business city as wellfashion center of Italy.</description>

      <description>River Loire is one of the four major rivers of France. It had alwaysmajor importance to France. In the Medieval time or the best time ofFrench civilization French Rules and noble men of that time had builtlot of Chateau (castles) along this river. It is very close to Paris,which is one of the reasons to built their weekend home for hunting andrelaxation here.
We only visited three castles that Sunday.</description>
