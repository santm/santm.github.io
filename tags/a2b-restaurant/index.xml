stop at A2B restaurant at Krishnagiri reached Madurai exactly by
11.30AM. Then took some time to find out decent hotel two friends
recommended “Royal
Court”
near Madurai railway station. The hotel is clean and neat the management
was great to upgrade our room to executive suite as the original room
smelt cigarettes.
After settling we had a vegetarian south Indian lunch at market area.</description></item></channel></rss>
