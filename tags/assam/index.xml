I know it sounds oxymoron but trust me when you are on the road for some time you need a day or two just doing nothing. Majuli was supposed to a magical place for us.
As we drove back west from Sivsagar we took the diversion to Nematighat, the boat embarkation point (ferry ghat) to go to Majuli.</description></item><item><title>Sivasagar - Unexplored Ahom Kingdom's finest</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2020-01-04-sivasagar-unexplored-ahom-kingdoms-finest/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2020 12:28:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2020-01-04-sivasagar-unexplored-ahom-kingdoms-finest/</guid><description>When I was planning this long trip to Assam I always wanted to drive all the way up to Dibrugarh where I studied till class 5. Later, in the final planning stage realized it was too long of a drive. Covering Guwahati, Shillong &amp;amp; Dibrugarh was getting too much in one trip so saved it for a later day. Sivasagar remained in the itinerary for a night stay with a condition if we finish Gibbon-Hollongapar and still have time to explore the ancient capital of the Ahom kingdom.</description></item><item><title>A morning at Hoollongapar Gibbon Sanctuary</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2020-01-03-a-morning-at-hoollongapar-gibbon-sanctuary/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 21:27:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2020-01-03-a-morning-at-hoollongapar-gibbon-sanctuary/</guid><description>Our trip to Hollong was one of the most challenging and memorable ones.
Still, after so many months, it remains clear like yesterday. We slept
early knowing we have to leave early. So when the alarm went off at 4 AM
the whole place was quiet and dark. We hauled all our luggage from the
room to the rented car. It was a bit of a task given that we were
staying backside of the property.</description></item><item><title>Gibbon Wildlife -- Things to know before vising.</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2020-01-03-gibbon-wildlife-things-to-know-before-vising/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 13:45:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2020-01-03-gibbon-wildlife-things-to-know-before-vising/</guid><description>Hollongapar GIBBON WILDLIFE SANCTUARY Hollong - the state tree of Aaasm. The story goes back like this when
the British came and saw these long trees, they asked How Long? And
it became Hollong Tree. Just like &amp;ldquo;there is a brown crow&amp;rdquo; was a
way to say &amp;ldquo;Darwaza
bandh Karo**&amp;rdquo; (close the door in Hindi &amp;ndash; from Satyajit
Ray&amp;rsquo;s Feludaa).It is only 20 sq KM of Sanctuary. Actually, it is the oldest
miscellaneous plantation having Dipterocarpus and Mesua as dominant
species It was declared a Reserve by the British way back in 1881,(53
years after the advent of British rule) The original forests used to
extend to the foothills of the Patkai mountain range.</description></item><item><title>Second Day in Kaziranga (April 2018)</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2020-01-03-second-day-in-kaziranga-april-2018/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 13:32:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2020-01-03-second-day-in-kaziranga-april-2018/</guid><description>Our hotel Wild Grass was next to Central Zone.

It has three
prominent zones - Central, Western and Eastern.
Central Range &amp;ndash; This drive covers the central region of the park.
It is an ideal introduction to the park and its ecology as the route
passes through the entire spectrum of habitat types prevalent in the
Kaziranga area. (though Brahmaputra view is not available, a stretch of
the route goes by the tributary river Difloo) There is a possibility of
sighting elephants as well as the other big animals especially the swamp
buffalo and of course the rhino.</description></item><item><title>Day 1 in Kaziranga - April 2018</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2019-02-20-day-1-in-kaziranga-april-2018/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Feb 2019 15:04:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2019-02-20-day-1-in-kaziranga-april-2018/</guid><description>After a good night sleep with thunders and rain, the morning was clear
of rain but the sky had overcast. Without much delay, we put all our
stuff in the car and head out of the resort for Kaziranga. The best
thing about the resort for us its proximity to the highway. We drive on
the straight highway going east. The road was divided four lanes and
there was not much traffic and was cruising around 100KM/Hr.</description></item><item><title>Sight Seeing Sohra (Cherrapunjee)</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2018-12-27-sight-seeing-sohra-cherrapunjee/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Dec 2018 18:32:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2018-12-27-sight-seeing-sohra-cherrapunjee/</guid><description>As usual, the sun went up early as we are the Eastern part of India, so
after a good breakfast and settling our bills we left towards
Cherrpunjee. The sky was cloudy but not raining. The 16KM drive is a
long one from the resort we stayed and the road of last 8 KM was really
bad. We started with Thangkharang Park which looked farthest on the map.
The road was good for the most part but again the last 4/5 KM was under
heavy construction.</description></item><item><title>Day 2 - Shillong</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2018-05-21-day-2-shillong/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 May 2018 11:29:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2018-05-21-day-2-shillong/</guid><description>We started early morning with a drive to pick-up point of our rented
car. This place was in such an area where proper roads were not
there….it was full of potholes and filled with rainwater from previous
rains. One thing is there Guwahati inner roads are not great and even
city is not that clean&amp;hellip;full of plastics. Anyways we zoomed out from
that place without much wastage of time and hit the highway.</description></item><item><title>Day - 1 Maa Kamakhya here we come !!!</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2018-05-19-day-1-maa-kamakhya-here-we-come/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 May 2018 19:36:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2018-05-19-day-1-maa-kamakhya-here-we-come/</guid><description>Guwahati Kamakhya
The flight to Guwahati was too early in the morning from Bangalore and
we decided upon that on landing we will go directly to Kamakhya temple
before starting our trip. Kamakhya Temple is around 14KM from the
airport and our relatives stay on the other side of the city. It makes
sense to start the trip in an auspicious way and we tried to strike 2
birds with one.</description></item><item><title>North East 2018 planning</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2018-05-18-north-east-2018-planning/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 May 2018 18:34:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2018-05-18-north-east-2018-planning/</guid><description>Long prologue … someone once said
***“Happiness is to plan a trip to somewhere new with your loved
ones”. ***
One best friend from Santanu’s engineering college got transferred from
Bangalore to Shillong last year. In his send-off party, everyone
committed that they would like to visit that part of the country. The
friend in question is serving our country and he promised to be our host
there while we visit Shillong, the Scotland of East and British summer
capital of North East.</description></item></channel></rss>
