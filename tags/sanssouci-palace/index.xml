      <description>Today sun and clouds chase each other across the skies along the shoresof Berlin as it glides past. We decided to visit Potsdam city situatedon southwest of Berlin known for Sanssouci (without worries) palace;reached there by train.
As we were short of time having our return ticket to Paris same eveningwe opted for sight-seeing guided tour bus available right outside thetrain station. So along with other tourists we visited new palace, oldtown hall, Fortunaportal and Nikolaikirche at Alter Markt, SchlossCecilienhof, Potsdamâ€™s Brandenburg gate, Dutch colony, Russian colonyAlexandrowka providing flair of a city steeped in European tradition.</description>
