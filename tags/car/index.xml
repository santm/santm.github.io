The planning for the trip started almost a month back. It involved looking at Google maps multiple times and talking to few friends who are roadies. We knew the road till Hyderabad would be good as we been on this highway almost 2 years back. Beyond Hyderabad was a complete unknown. Also posted my naïve query to TEAM-BHP.</description></item><item><title>A small nano but long wait</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2011-09-23-a-small-nano-but-long-wait/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2011 18:56:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2011-09-23-a-small-nano-but-long-wait/</guid><description>Beginning of this year sold our Indica and bought Swift-Dzire(ZDI) which
we found very practical and perfect for our Indian need. And we did not
thought of booking any new car in recent time. Suddenly things got
changed when Pamela started a new job in May. We were quite happy with
single car and personally opted for BIAS (Bangalore International
Airport - Volvo) as I commute from Hebbal to Old Airport read every day
around 20KM one way.</description></item><item><title>Aarush's-Free ride</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2010-05-11-aarushs-free-ride/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2010 22:13:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2010-05-11-aarushs-free-ride/</guid><description>Well another small post with pictures. These pictures of Aarush are
months apart. One on left with motorcycle are just after his tonsuring
and on the right are just weeks old. He really likes to ride like any
other boy. And if we try to stop him it does not go well at public
place. When we were in Star Bazaar @ Kormangala few weeks back he
remembered where this toy car was kept and every time we tried to
refrain him he used to go back there.</description></item><item><title>Drive to heritage site - Lepakshi</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2009-03-03-drive-to-heritage-site-lepakshi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Mar 2009 05:52:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2009-03-03-drive-to-heritage-site-lepakshi/</guid><description>My 1st term is coming to an end and we are given the upcoming test as
well project submission dates. On reaching home from class on Saturday I
was desperate to go out of Bangalore to get charged to combat the
upcoming gruelling weeks at work and personal front with study. I had no
clue where to go for a day and started to check my faithful websites and
zeroed on Lepakshi from Anita’s

take for year 2008 - this gave us 9 days off with two weekends. I
preferred a week before Christmas to avoid traffic and tourist.
Initial plan was to leave Bangalore on Sunday for Mysore and move
from there depending on Aarush&amp;rsquo;s comfort. Stepping out of the home with
him means a disrupted routine and adapting to a new environment for all
us.</description></item><item><title>Passion of reading</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2008-05-30-passion-of-reading/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2008 17:57:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2008-05-30-passion-of-reading/</guid><description>This question really sounds absurd to start a decent discussion on
reading. I am not a writer nor pose to have any writing skill but I like
to read. It is said the type of books you read generally depends on your
attitude and personality. I believe reading as a habit has always
allowed to nurture a wholesome sense of well being. But most of us read
books to lull ourselves to sleep.</description></item><item><title>Letter to my son</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2008-05-15-letter-to-my-son/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2008 23:14:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2008-05-15-letter-to-my-son/</guid><description>Hello Aarush,
Today you are four months old&amp;hellip;though nothing remarkable but for me it
has been days now since we met last. Hope you to be fit as fiddle.
I came to know from your mom that now your vision is focused more or
less, you are trying to grasp objects; can bat and swipe at dangling
toys. It seems now you are ready to rock and roll as you have started
taking side turns with squirms, giggles and wails&amp;hellip; You respond to your
nani (granny) and aunt with big toothless smiles as well with coos and
making happy noises.</description></item><item><title>Goodbye – Mumbai – a quick update</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2008-05-02-goodbye-mumbai-a-quick-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2008 00:41:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2008-05-02-goodbye-mumbai-a-quick-update/</guid><description>I
did not want to use a title like “Welcome to Bangalore” or “Here I
come to Bangaloru” on purpose as need some time before I can call this
my new home. From long time we were knowing that we have to move to
Banglore but on personal grounds I had to postpone it which was readily
accepted by my company. In recent months, I was waiting for that green
signal from my company that I have to move in any case.</description></item><item><title>Perfect Parking</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2008-04-18-perfect-parking/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2008 18:52:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2008-04-18-perfect-parking/</guid><description>Encountered this perfect parking on a small by-lane in Bangalore. For
sure I will not be able to park like this; normally have enough
difficulties in parallel parking on the street between cars. I was
failed (fatal) as rear tire touched the ramp in my first attempt to
secure Californian driving License. Looks like the owner will not be

small car.</description></item><item><title>Shiv Jayanti</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2008-04-07-shiv-jayanti/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2008 20:35:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2008-04-07-shiv-jayanti/</guid><description>“Shiv jayanti” should not be confused with Shivratri (Night of
lord Shiva)- marked with devotion to one of most powerful lord in Hindu
mythology. While Shiv jayanti (Birthday) is celebration of birth
anniversary of Shivaji Maharaj who ruled Maratha region in 17th
century fighting against powerful Mughal Empire of North-India. He was
named Shiva, after the local Goddess Shivai, to whom his mother Jijabai
had prayed for a son.</description></item><item><title>Bhat Suar</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2008-03-23-bhat-suar/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2008 07:51:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2008-03-23-bhat-suar/</guid><description>Every time I visit my in-laws and see one of these “Bhat Suar”
(three-wheeler cart) on the road it brings back memories of my college
days. Durg(in-law’s place) and Bhopal(college day) were part of same
state 6 years back; although politically divided they are very similar
to an outsider like me on social and geographical terms.
First part of the name comes from the sound they make “Bhat-Bhat”
and second part “suar which means pig”.</description></item><item><title>Hebbal Lake</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2008-02-24-hebbal-lake/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Feb 2008 21:06:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2008-02-24-hebbal-lake/</guid><description>Last weekend I was in Bangalore and was checking progress on
construction site. Well will this be a view if we move there; but as at
work things are not yet crystal clear for the upcoming move. It is a
nice view to have from kitchen they say a happy person always makes a
happy meal. With new Bangalore airport going to be operational in next
month this side of town is going to see lots of traffic and that is
going to add more worries for already worried Bangaloreans.</description></item><item><title>An announcement</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2008-01-29-an-announcement/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2008 01:05:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2008-01-29-an-announcement/</guid><description>This announcement was long due on our blog. Though this breaking news
was shared on d-day instantly with friends and families from Hospital
via SMS and emails. I specifically carried my camera, laptop and
wireless data card for the same.
I created two announcement cards one in pink and other in blue with two
names (for girl and boy) and kept them ready. We never disclosed this
big-news in last few months in our blog in-fact it was kept secret to
many except close family members and few friends.</description></item><item><title>Berlin Diary</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-12-06-berlin-diary/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2007 19:12:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-12-06-berlin-diary/</guid><description>Today while leafing through the pages of our album found yet another
trip waiting to be jotted down before it gets erased from our memory. A
trip to Berlin where present and past are in sync once again.
We went there for 3days- 2 nights stay by train on Easter weekend when
sky was gloomy and mercury dropped to almost freezing point but didn’t
deter our enthu to explore city as much possible.</description></item><item><title>Venice at leisure</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-11-27-venice-at-leisure/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2007 22:26:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-11-27-venice-at-leisure/</guid><description>Next day, when we woke up, were very happy to see blue sky after two
days of grey sky. Around 9.00 AM we came by boat to hot-spot St. Mark&amp;rsquo;s
Square. St. Mark&amp;rsquo;s Basilica which is Byzantine influenced was too
crowded to visit that time and unfortunately in evening we ran out of
time and could not make it so satisfied ourselves from outside only.
Doge&amp;rsquo;s Palace is a gothic palace with bridge of sighs at rear end
which is made of white limestone and has windows with stone bars.</description></item><item><title>Siena</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-11-25-siena/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Nov 2007 20:22:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-11-25-siena/</guid><description>There are plenty of places to explore in Tuscan region from Florence as
day trip. We decided to visit Siena which is only one hour. Reason
for choosing Siena was for its medieval beauty; in that era Siena and
Florence were at war when Florence defeated Siena.
Travel by road through Tuscan region is really amazing as you cross
those post-card hills. But exhausted from yesterdays walking on the
cobble stone roads of Florence I dozed as soon we hit the highway that
made Santanu bit furious as he couldn’t share those moments.</description></item><item><title>Cinqueterre – Mediterranean nirvana</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-11-22-cinqueterre-mediterranean-nirvana/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Nov 2007 20:13:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-11-22-cinqueterre-mediterranean-nirvana/</guid><description>We got up early had a quick breakfast and dragged our bags to Milan
Central Station; bought our ticket for next destination
“Cinqueterre” - refers to five small villages (Corniglia,
Manarola, Monterosso al Mare, Riomaggiore and Vernazza) - cling to
the rugged mountains along Mediterranean coastline with breath taking
view.
This UNSECO heritage site is not on the main train line or motor-way
that connects Milan to Rome. To get there, we have to cross the mountain
to reach the western side of Italy.</description></item><item><title>Fresh Tomato Soup</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-11-19-fresh-tomato-soup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Nov 2007 20:02:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-11-19-fresh-tomato-soup/</guid><description>Till far only soup ever tried to make was carrot soup in Paris that too
in bleak winter. Big thanks to my French Teacher for sharing the
recipe en Français. Recently, went to local vegetable market; seeing
tomato got so tempted that without thinking bought two kilos. Then I
brainstormed a bit to think and idea of soup came as an escape. Here is
my 2 cents recipe. If craving for something sweet and sour at the
same time just have a bowl of creamy tomato soup to satisfy your desire
as an appetizer.</description></item><item><title>Calamity of Mid life &amp; middle class</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-10-17-calamity-of-mid-life-middle-class/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2007 16:38:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-10-17-calamity-of-mid-life-middle-class/</guid><description>It is impossible not to eavesdrop when people are having a loud
conversation on phone in Mumbai&amp;rsquo;s life line - local train.
Unlike other days today morning, was special one which is worth
describing.
A guy gets in; stands next to me and elbows me to make his room and
starts chatting over mobile (so how it goes&amp;hellip;.).
“Sorry yaar (friend) had to switch off the mobile as train was coming
in; you know how much rush is there nowadays.</description></item><item><title>Cabbies of Mumbai</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-09-28-cabbies-of-mumbai/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Sep 2007 18:02:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-09-28-cabbies-of-mumbai/</guid><description>Black and yellow metered taxi’s made famous by Bollywood movies play
a major role of public transport in Mumbai other then auto rickshaws,
trains and buses. In New York they are yellow, in London they are
Black and in Mumbai they’re both yellow and black. They are part of
Mumbai heritage. Normally, they move in snail space at peak hours which
may depend on the area traversed and the state of the roads.</description></item><item><title>Sweet potato dessert</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-09-11-sweet-potato-dessert/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2007 04:12:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-09-11-sweet-potato-dessert/</guid><description>Sweet potato dessert (Ranga Alur Puli) is an age old Bengali dessert - a
sweet lover&amp;rsquo;s delight for sure. Its crispy outer layer mesmerizes
gastronomic senses. As for its availability, it is more of a
traditional sweet, prepared in households. These days some sweet shops
are starting to include this in their repertoire to cater to the
time-constrained generation.
My hubby being born with a sweet tooth, do enjoy sweet of any kind.</description></item><item><title>Sale</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-08-06-sale/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Aug 2007 15:39:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-08-06-sale/</guid><description>A four letter word of our modern consumerism; like all other 4 letters
words this is very commonly used.
The first time I was introduced to this was back in USA on Labor Day
weekend (1st week of September-’98). In US, every long weekend
brings a SALE. Size of weekend supplement of news-paper increases
with advertisement from cars to toys. Not only that even you get
constant reminder from Macy’s to Wal-mart on your radio while you drive
your car.</description></item><item><title>Cart in city road</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-07-16-cart-in-city-road/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jul 2007 21:44:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-07-16-cart-in-city-road/</guid><description>While coming to work this morning oxen (castrated male) cart
carrying sugar canes caught my attention. It is not a common site to see
a bullock cart or hand pulled cart (pulled or pushed by a man) at the
heart of Mumbai city next to VT Station.
They are not allowed in the main roads of the city but can only move in
the peripheral roads of the city. These kinds of slow moving objects
cause most notorious traffic jam in India.</description></item><item><title>C for Cab and Cricket</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-07-12-c-for-cab-and-cricket/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jul 2007 17:08:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-07-12-c-for-cab-and-cricket/</guid><description>Cricket – is India’s gorgeous past time – it is not taken as a sport.
This picture was taken during Cricket World Cup of 2007 inside a
Mumbai cab. But somehow I never posted the same. I am not a big cricket
fan but is impossible to avoid cricket while you are in India.
In recent time, performance of Indian cricket team is quite
disappointing. But that does not change Indians breathing cricket - be
at India or abroad.</description></item><item><title>“Amby” in city of joy</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-06-28-amby-in-city-of-joy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jun 2007 04:14:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-06-28-amby-in-city-of-joy/</guid><description>Calcutta (Kolkata) – mega city of Eastern India. In this vibrant
city with a distinct socio-political culture, cabs are grand old
Ambassadors from Hindustan Motors and most of cars are manufactured
from the nearby plant of Uttarpara. This picture was taken next to major
long distance Sealdah Railway Station which shows that city of joy
still struggles with traffic congestion. Unlike of other major cities
where Tata indica or fiat or Maruti are common hired forms of mechanised

Though just few minutes before I took my shower. Having my last portion

actually I forgot to buy one. My all time favourite item which I can

Dona-Paula (bypass Miramar beach). Old Goa churches-Bom Jesus Basilica

if you want more than just sun, surf and sand. It gives lot of freedom
but can be perilous at same time. On second day early morning we haggled
at least with three owners for renting and lastly ended up with Activa
for Rupees 250(it is better to rent for long durations to get good
price). Another reason for renting was we wanted to go to Bicholim to
visit Santanu’s maternal uncle for dinner.</description></item><item><title>Viva GOA - Preamble</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-04-14-viva-goa-preamble/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Apr 2007 06:12:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-04-14-viva-goa-preamble/</guid><description>Trip to Goa was long due may-be you can say from 2001 when I got
opportunity as a teacher with my school children. But unfortunately, I
couldn’t make as I was supposed to behave as good girl. Good unmarried
Indian girls don’t go anywhere without an escort. To qualify as an
escort there are lots of criteria to be checked and considered like

have a long way to go before it will be any precious or strong material.
This day is special in another way as it is birthday of Prateek
(maternal cousin of mine). Now we stay above floor from Prateek. After
our wedding this is the first time that we three are together.</description></item><item><title>Local trains of Mumbai</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2006-11-28-local-trains-of-mumbai/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2006 15:20:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2006-11-28-local-trains-of-mumbai/</guid><description>After moving to Mumbai (India) commuting from one place to another was a
big problem (as we didn’t have our own vehicle). It seems Mumbai local
trains are the most efficient one carrying millions of people everyday.
Getting in and out of local trains is one of the hardest tasks
particularly during rush hours which every mumbains has to undergo at
least ones in their life. So, lot of advice was given from Santanu’s
maternal family who are staying here for more than 15 years.</description></item><item><title>Aids Awareness - Paris</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2006-10-10-aids-awareness-paris/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2006 10:24:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2006-10-10-aids-awareness-paris/</guid><description>Can any one guess what this publicity is about? Well, this is 2006 anti
Aids campaign by city hall of Paris (Paris protège l&amp;rsquo;amour means
Paris protects love)
In the photo what we see is sunset on some historical building with moon
at backdrop, but when you take a close look moon is&amp;hellip; a condom. It aims
at promoting the use of condoms among the population i.e., to have safe
sex.</description></item><item><title>Few books</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2006-09-30-few-books/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Sep 2006 12:10:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2006-09-30-few-books/</guid><description>Being in vacation and doing nothing much whole day I am left with lots
of free time to read. It is great way to pass quality time with rain and
heat where nothing interests me outdoor. I already finished few books in
last 3 weeks.
Starting with, Dan Brown’s trash ‘Angel &amp;amp; Demon’ and ‘Digital

in recent years was visiting India on holiday from Europe. Like all
other events in life this can be looked at like a coin; on one side the
travel time has reduced significantly while on other side only 20 to 30
kilos of baggage allowed compared to California (65 Kilo).
As we were moving out of Paris we had lot of important things to bring
along with us that we will need till our shipment arrives in next 5
weeks time.</description></item><item><title>Making of Chocolate Charlotte</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2006-08-28-making-of-chocolate-charlotte/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2006 18:46:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2006-08-28-making-of-chocolate-charlotte/</guid><description>Today we have a dinner invitation; spent whole yesterday morning in
thinking what would be good to prepare as I did not want to buy anything
from supermarket. Since we are moving, wanted to clean the fridge
without overstuffing it. So after lot of thought came to conclusion that
charlotte might be best. Learnt this recipe from a friend.
A charlotte is any dessert that&amp;rsquo;s moulded into a container lined
with sponge fingers or boudoir biscuits (purchased at a bakery or

walked around Paris last week.
New in gallery - bibs from running . Well you must be wondering what is
that ? For a person like me from whom the activity of sport was taken
away by various pressures at young age it means a lot. The good side of
it is that I am the very few fortunate one to run at this age at various

make best use of our Swiss flexi pass.
On boarding the train from Luzern to Engelberg we realized that it’s
more of Desi train. From train station, routes are well marked for

discussing about hitch hiking to the next big town which was ruled out
by Santanu as it seems not safe. Even I was suggesting him how about
getting into a car of people who does not look that young and suddenly
one car stopped and they asked if we need any lift… looking at their
face we did not take a second to decide and say “YES” in unison (which
came out as if instinct) with big smiling face.</description></item><item><title>Post Bus - 19th June</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-15-post-bus-19th-june/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2006 14:08:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-15-post-bus-19th-june/</guid><description>Till we are not sure what would be our next destination for today. The
nearest attraction is Montreaux, but that being so close to Lausanne we
were discussing to keep it for last day. After taking a hearty breakfast
we reached railway station. We asked at the information desk about the
Swiss travel pass and Post Bus.
Traveling with yellow Swiss post bus system is really breath taking

For me France lost but at same time Italy neither win as they just
waited for the final penalty shoot out to happen. I do not like the way
Italian play football in general. They make it dull and boring. Italian
and their relation to non Italian footballer are well known. And this
time the whole nation is waiting for the verdict of match fixing in

be the most alluring for tourist destinations. But it is the most
important city in the entire Eastern Himalayas due to its geographical

there are few things which got changed in India which my RADAR didn&amp;rsquo;t
notice before. I am not going to debate on their pros and cons. Any
changes are more noticeable when we encounter the same old place or

Like
usual I am going to start with the traffic jams, one way roads,
unavailability of parking, high parking tickets and very unusual sense
of Parisian driving skills.
These only list if you have a car and travelling of your own. But what
about those who are taking other mode of smart transports like Bus,
Tram, Bicycle, Rollerblade or just walk to work or work from home?</description></item><item><title>Place de la Concorde</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2005-10-30-place-de-la-concorde/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2005 21:07:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2005-10-30-place-de-la-concorde/</guid><description>After a long time I was able to
capture the fountain of Place de la Concordein a very beautiful sunny morning. It is
so amazing that we still take pictures of Paris like tourist on their

bus and got down next to the Casino of Exposition. But today it is a
public holiday at Seville which we did not knew, so the roads were quite
empty at 9 in the morning. After getting down from the bus we walked
towards Plaza de Espana. Plaza de Espana was built for 1929 world expo.

Cordoba first. But later friends who had been there suggested
visiting Cordoba.
We walked from our hotel on the busy morning streets of Seville to reach

37° C when we reached Granada in the afternoon. The bus station for
intercity is not at the city center but there is a good connection of

Royal.
Around 5 PM, we headed out from hotel, it was still very hot and bright.
We walked towards Plaza Nueva.</description></item><item><title>Provence - South of France</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2004-05-10-provence-south-of-france/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2004 00:32:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2004-05-10-provence-south-of-france/</guid><description>We have been thinking to visit South of France for a long time.
