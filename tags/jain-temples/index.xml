But luck is
always not in favour we got one nasty cab driver unlike Jaipur. Although
hired cab through hotel and asked to take us to Osyian but he insisted
on going to majestic sandstone palace of Umaid Bhawan. Before going
there he took us to shops for early morning shopping but we
didnâ€™t.(they get commission when they take clients to their choice of
place).</description></item></channel></rss>
