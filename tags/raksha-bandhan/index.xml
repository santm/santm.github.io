      <description>It is a celebration of unconditional love between brother and sister inHindu culture. This age old celebration tries to remind us of thebeautiful and unique relationship between brother and sister celebratedsince time immemorial. Sisters tie sacred threads on brothers wristasking for longer &amp;amp; healthy life of brother and brothers in-turn vow toprotect (to save her- Raksha) their sisters from any unpleasantsituations of life on this day.</description>
