When digital camera came out with decent mega pixel was an early adapter
of the same. But soon realized sharing Pictures on email was not an
option and hosted pictures on Tripod. Oh! they used to give 10MB of
free hosting :) now Flicker gives one 1TB free. So long story small
after the managing own gallyery app writen initally with csv and php ,
later mysql and php and lastly Gallery for almost 10 years.</description></item><item><title>Moving away from self hosting</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2013-12-14-moving-away-from-self-hosting/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Dec 2013 08:55:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2013-12-14-moving-away-from-self-hosting/</guid><description>Well after all these years of self hosting and WordPress I am kind of
let go the Self-hosting. Moved
pamela.santm.com to Tumblr and all the
pictures from Gallery3 to
Flickr.Â Still need to move www.santm.com somewhere and aarush.santm,com pictures
to somewhere, most likely it will be Flickr again. hope to complete the
all these before 2013 finishes.</description></item></channel></rss>
