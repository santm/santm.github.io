reading. I am not a writer nor pose to have any writing skill but I like
to read. It is said the type of books you read generally depends on your
attitude and personality. I believe reading as a habit has always
allowed to nurture a wholesome sense of well being. But most of us read
books to lull ourselves to sleep.</description></item><item><title>London 5days (July 29th - Aug 3rd)</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2003-08-11-london-5days-july-29th-aug-3rd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2003 23:21:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2003-08-11-london-5days-july-29th-aug-3rd/</guid><description>We went to London the proper Bilayet (Foreign land -as mentioned by
S.Rushdie ) for five days. We stayed as guest of Sampath, at his home
bit outside of London. The trip would not have been so pleasant and
memorable without his help and warm hospitality.
We reached around noon at Waterloo station by Eurostar. After keeping
our luggage at cloak room we went straight to London Eye. It was a
nice start to see all the monuments of London from birds view.</description></item></channel></rss>
