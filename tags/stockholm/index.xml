was a very attractive deal by Ryan Air to Stockholm.We went there middle
of August when Paris was burning with summer heat. It was a great escape
to Scandinavia. Stockholm was very clean and very beautiful. Although,
the weather was not at its best as it rained for first two days.
We stayed in the centre of Stockholm (Drottninggatan) one side of this
pedestrian street with full of shops.</description></item></channel></rss>
