lord Shiva)- marked with devotion to one of most powerful lord in Hindu
mythology. While Shiv jayanti (Birthday) is celebration of birth
anniversary of Shivaji Maharaj who ruled Maratha region in 17th
century fighting against powerful Mughal Empire of North-India. He was
named Shiva, after the local Goddess Shivai, to whom his mother Jijabai
had prayed for a son.</description></item><item><title>Berlin Diary- Potsdam</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-12-22-berlin-diary-potsdam/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Dec 2007 15:13:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-12-22-berlin-diary-potsdam/</guid><description>Today sun and clouds chase each other across the skies along the shores
of Berlin as it glides past. We decided to visit Potsdam city situated
on southwest of Berlin known for Sanssouci (without worries) palace;
reached there by train.
As we were short of time having our return ticket to Paris same evening
we opted for sight-seeing guided tour bus available right outside the
train station. So along with other tourists we visited new palace, old
town hall, Fortunaportal and Nikolaikirche at Alter Markt, Schloss
Cecilienhof, Potsdam’s Brandenburg gate, Dutch colony, Russian colony
Alexandrowka providing flair of a city steeped in European tradition.</description></item><item><title>Berlin Diary</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-12-06-berlin-diary/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2007 19:12:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-12-06-berlin-diary/</guid><description>Today while leafing through the pages of our album found yet another
trip waiting to be jotted down before it gets erased from our memory. A
trip to Berlin where present and past are in sync once again.
We went there for 3days- 2 nights stay by train on Easter weekend when
sky was gloomy and mercury dropped to almost freezing point but didn’t
deter our enthu to explore city as much possible.</description></item><item><title>Milan shopping - trip came to end</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-11-30-milan-shopping-trip-came-to-end/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Nov 2007 16:46:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-11-30-milan-shopping-trip-came-to-end/</guid><description>Time to say Ciao, a presto (bye, see u soon) to Venice!!! Although
we knew it might never be soon again. With a happy mood, we left for
Milan from where we started our memorable journey. We boarded Euro-star
for which we had to make an advance reservation. Indisputably it was the
best train we boarded in last seven days. On reaching Milan kept our
luggage in lock room and set off to explore the business city as well
fashion center of Italy.</description></item><item><title>Venice at leisure</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-11-27-venice-at-leisure/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2007 22:26:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-11-27-venice-at-leisure/</guid><description>Next day, when we woke up, were very happy to see blue sky after two
days of grey sky. Around 9.00 AM we came by boat to hot-spot St. Mark&amp;rsquo;s
Square. St. Mark&amp;rsquo;s Basilica which is Byzantine influenced was too
crowded to visit that time and unfortunately in evening we ran out of
time and could not make it so satisfied ourselves from outside only.
Doge&amp;rsquo;s Palace is a gothic palace with bridge of sighs at rear end
which is made of white limestone and has windows with stone bars.</description></item><item><title>An afteroon at Pisa</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-11-23-an-afteroon-at-pisa/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Nov 2007 20:16:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-11-23-an-afteroon-at-pisa/</guid><description>Being exhausted from last evening we got up bit late and had very good
breakfast before hitting the road. According to our itinerary, distance
to be covered was long one as our hotel was booked at Florence.
We took train to La Spezia, it was a crowded, got packed with each
passing stations of Cinque Terre but became empty as soon as we
crossed Riomaggiore. We had to wait a bit at La Spezia as train was

Central Station; bought our ticket for next destination
“Cinqueterre” - refers to five small villages (Corniglia,
Manarola, Monterosso al Mare, Riomaggiore and Vernazza) - cling to
the rugged mountains along Mediterranean coastline with breath taking
view.
This UNSECO heritage site is not on the main train line or motor-way
that connects Milan to Rome. To get there, we have to cross the mountain
to reach the western side of Italy.</description></item><item><title>Milan and Lake Como</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-11-21-milan-and-lake-como/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Nov 2007 20:06:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-11-21-milan-and-lake-como/</guid><description>** Prologue:**
Weeklong journey of
Italy takes us back
to summer of 2004; due to various reasons never posted travelogues on
time though pictures from the same were published on time. Please hang
on as we try to recite detailed vacation from our faithful memory.
We had a night train from Bercy Station, Paris. For us, reaching Bercy
was bit far from our Metro Station (Exelmans on M9) as there was no easy
interchange; while on street-road map it looks closer from our
apartment.</description></item><item><title>Fresh Tomato Soup</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-11-19-fresh-tomato-soup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Nov 2007 20:02:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-11-19-fresh-tomato-soup/</guid><description>Till far only soup ever tried to make was carrot soup in Paris that too
in bleak winter. Big thanks to my French Teacher for sharing the
recipe en Français. Recently, went to local vegetable market; seeing
tomato got so tempted that without thinking bought two kilos. Then I
brainstormed a bit to think and idea of soup came as an escape. Here is
my 2 cents recipe. If craving for something sweet and sour at the
same time just have a bowl of creamy tomato soup to satisfy your desire
as an appetizer.</description></item><item><title>Sunsets in Mumbai</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-10-29-sunsets-in-mumbai/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Oct 2007 21:21:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-10-29-sunsets-in-mumbai/</guid><description>Sunset with blue sky of late October seems “magnifique” along with open
space of Navi Mumbai as viewed from local train (picture taken through
window)
This one I clicked last Saturday when I was stuck in middle of JJ
Flyover - the longest flyover in Mumbai (2.3 KM). It is constructed like
a snake, which makes its way through labyrinth of old buildings on
either side; basically you bypass the busy, crowded market underneath.</description></item><item><title>Calamity of Mid life &amp; middle class</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-10-17-calamity-of-mid-life-middle-class/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2007 16:38:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-10-17-calamity-of-mid-life-middle-class/</guid><description>It is impossible not to eavesdrop when people are having a loud
conversation on phone in Mumbai&amp;rsquo;s life line - local train.
Unlike other days today morning, was special one which is worth
describing.
A guy gets in; stands next to me and elbows me to make his room and
starts chatting over mobile (so how it goes&amp;hellip;.).
“Sorry yaar (friend) had to switch off the mobile as train was coming
in; you know how much rush is there nowadays.</description></item><item><title>Cabbies of Mumbai</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-09-28-cabbies-of-mumbai/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Sep 2007 18:02:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-09-28-cabbies-of-mumbai/</guid><description>Black and yellow metered taxi’s made famous by Bollywood movies play
a major role of public transport in Mumbai other then auto rickshaws,
trains and buses. In New York they are yellow, in London they are
Black and in Mumbai they’re both yellow and black. They are part of
Mumbai heritage. Normally, they move in snail space at peak hours which
may depend on the area traversed and the state of the roads.</description></item><item><title>Remembering Belgium</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-09-17-remembering-belgium/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2007 05:31:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-09-17-remembering-belgium/</guid><description>While categorizing our old travelogs I found there was no post on
Belgium
which values a lot for me. As I go down the memory lane&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;year 2003,
within 2 ½ months of marriage we have to move to Paris from US which was
a big change for me. Apart from the cultural shock, language was immense
barrier for day today life as well to mingle up with people around. Not
only that, in Indian arrange marriage, it takes time to understand each
other with each one&amp;rsquo;s weaknesses and failings.</description></item><item><title>Sweet potato dessert</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-09-11-sweet-potato-dessert/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2007 04:12:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-09-11-sweet-potato-dessert/</guid><description>Sweet potato dessert (Ranga Alur Puli) is an age old Bengali dessert - a
sweet lover&amp;rsquo;s delight for sure. Its crispy outer layer mesmerizes
gastronomic senses. As for its availability, it is more of a
traditional sweet, prepared in households. These days some sweet shops
are starting to include this in their repertoire to cater to the
time-constrained generation.
My hubby being born with a sweet tooth, do enjoy sweet of any kind.</description></item><item><title>Le Ciel</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-08-23-le-ciel/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Aug 2007 03:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-08-23-le-ciel/</guid><description>While rain still continues in South Asian countries; People from Karachi

From last two
consecutive weeks particularly weekends (June 23-24 &amp;amp; June 30-July 1)
there were disruption of normal life due to heavy shower. Thank God,
those were weekends otherwise life of 20 million people would have
affected some way or other as many schools and offices are closed. We
stayed mostly inside and I only ventured
out twice to nearby

vegetable shopping in APMC [Agro Product Market] close to Vashi.
Prices for every vegetables went up. Due to lack of infrastructure it
was a shame to see so much wastage due to heavy rain. From the posture
of the seller it was quite clear he was not looking for lot of customers
as he stretches his back.</description></item><item><title>Hue of the sky</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-06-20-hue-of-the-sky/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jun 2007 03:11:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-06-20-hue-of-the-sky/</guid><description>Siliguri is gateway to the North East of India.

It is a base point to head towards Darjeeling, Sikkim, kalimpong,

rail traffic to the neighboring countries of Nepal, Bhutan and
Bangladesh.
Situated at foot of Eastern Himalayas it has very pleasant temperature

Mumbai-local; an unexpected encounter with refined human behavior in
this Maximum city. I was retuning home in a local train and lucky to be
seated as I started from VT terminus. In the mid way a family of three
boarded the train; it is quite out of the way for a female passenger to
get into general or male compartment at the rush hour.</description></item><item><title>Hearty Healthy</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-05-30-hearty-healthy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2007 03:07:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-05-30-hearty-healthy/</guid><description>It’s too hot and humid with power failure I was sweating like a hell.
Though just few minutes before I took my shower. Having my last portion

actually I forgot to buy one. My all time favourite item which I can
even take truckload if needed in any form. It is generally considered to

culture. There is a vast population of middle class in India and within
middle class there are three distinct sub-divisions - “lower
middleclass”, “middle middleclass” and “higher middleclass”.
Comprehending the complexities of Indian society is not that easy.
Though there are variations in socio-economic life within these three
but one thing is common between all of them - everyone is curious to
know whatz happening in others life despite of their own busy life.</description></item><item><title>Mumbaiya Lingo</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-04-06-mumbaiya-lingo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Apr 2007 03:29:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-04-06-mumbaiya-lingo/</guid><description>While boarding a train I heard one co-passenger saying to another
“Tabadtod andar jaane ka” which astonished me for a fraction of
second as its not at all palatable to an untrained ears. It seems this
“Tabadtod andar jaane ka” is considered far more effective while getting
into locals then long winded formal request to the people ahead to make
way.
I was trying hard to relate as it sounds hindi but actually its not.</description></item><item><title>Mahabaleshwar-Weekend getaway</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2007-03-21-mahabaleshwar-weekend-getaway/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Mar 2007 04:21:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2007-03-21-mahabaleshwar-weekend-getaway/</guid><description>Unlike last

After
that now there are constant reminders for the commuters to be on alert
and check their surroundings. It is logistical nightmare to manage the
massive number of commuters who takes train every day in Mumbai. In
simple words, “impossible” will be closest word I can pick.
Few months back after lots of planning and public announcement Mumbai
Police conducted a security drill where every passenger was supposed to
pass via metal detector in two Main Terminus in the evening but after
few moments it was clear that police can not handle the stream of
passengers in lakhs and crores as they were heading home and it was

Getting in and out of local trains is one of the hardest tasks
particularly during rush hours which every mumbains has to undergo at

it is that I am the very few fortunate one to run at this age at various
places but rest remains as silent voice in vast population of India.</description></item><item><title>Swiss-Itenary, TGV and Gizmo</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2006-08-04-swiss-itenary-tgv-and-gizmo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2006 09:16:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2006-08-04-swiss-itenary-tgv-and-gizmo/</guid><description>Another
Friday, thinking to write something for my blog ;) I think I should have
kept a track of my Friday bloging or changes I made on Friday :D. Well,
this post is not going to be about Friday but it is about our
Switzerland itinerary, experience with TGV etc.
Might have noticed there are lots of posts by Pamela in recent time –
wish she would have done before from our other trips also.</description></item><item><title>Italian aroma…</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2006-08-01-italian-aroma/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2006 16:26:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2006-08-01-italian-aroma/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Daney Daney Pey likha hain khaney waley kaa naam&amp;rdquo;- which

Santanu has a tendency of encroaching cuisine area particularly on
weekend or on his official holidays depending on his mood. In a way,
it’s good as I get 2 days off.
We were just back from Switzerland and went for picnic at
St.-Germain-en-Laye with few colleagues of Santanu. And Santanu promised
he is going to prepare all by himself -simple vegetable-rice and Date
walnut brownies.
Lately I borrowed one book on vegetarian by Nicolas Graimes from one
friend which includes light meals, main courses, tarts, salads, desserts
etc.</description></item><item><title>A must list for swiss</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-19-a-must-list-for-swiss/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2006 19:01:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-19-a-must-list-for-swiss/</guid><description>Our trip to Switzerland has ended after all those C.B.G (châteaux,
bateaux and gateaux) trips around Europe but indeed it was a different
experience altogether. It is all about the greenery, mountain streams
rushing along, water falls, snow clad mountains, sounds of cow-bells
tickling on the alpine meadows.
I am not sure if every one is happy with their first trip to a new place
or not. But, I am always very happy and excited to go to new places.</description></item><item><title>Shhh …. Silence Please</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-19-shhh-silence-please/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2006 18:24:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-19-shhh-silence-please/</guid><description>Normally, I and Santanu don&amp;rsquo;t talk to each other on bus, train, flight
or whatsoever as we are normally lost in our own world and both try to
respect each others silence. We have books, newspaper, ipod for that
time but this particular evening we happened to talk so much while
returning to Zurich from Luzern. One of the reason maybe that by now we
are kind of used to watching beautiful sceneries from train as it runs
along lakes, rivers and creaking sometimes as it passes by the running
hills unfolding before us.</description></item><item><title>Golden Pass - Montreux</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-18-golden-pass-montreux/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2006 18:58:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-18-golden-pass-montreux/</guid><description>Today is the last day of our trip. We had already reserved for boarding
another panoramic train “Golden Express&amp;rdquo; which will take us to Lausanne
where we started our journey one week ago. By now I was so used to that
after waking up my first thing was to peer out the window to check
weather. And like every time it was bright sunny morning at our last day
of vacation.</description></item><item><title>Relaxing Day - 24th June</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-16-relaxing-day-24th-june/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2006 16:45:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-16-relaxing-day-24th-june/</guid><description>It meant to be a vacation within vacation today. As we did not have to
catch any train neither any bus nor get up early for any fixed
destination. Relaxingly, we had our self-made breakfast and then headed
towards railway station for renting a cycle to bike. At first, we went
towards the city center of Interlaken where there is a big Casino and
park. From there we biked all the way towards the lake Brienz.</description></item><item><title>Mount Jungfraujoch - 23rd June</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-16-mount-jungfraujoch-23rd-june/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2006 15:40:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-16-mount-jungfraujoch-23rd-june/</guid><description>Top of Europe Today we woke up very early as to move towards our next destination
Interlaken (means between two lakes). I immediately peered out the
window to check out what the weather was like. I was very concerned
about our trip to Mt. Jungfrau. But to me it seems to be a perfect day.
Santanu was bit hesitant as it was cloudy &amp;amp; gloomy all the way while
coming down from Mt.</description></item><item><title>Hiking Mt.Rigi - 22nd June</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-16-hiking-mt-rigi-22nd-june/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2006 14:40:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-16-hiking-mt-rigi-22nd-june/</guid><description>Queen of Swiss Mountains From Zurich we went to Mt. Rigi via Arth-Goldau a very short train ride.
From there we took the cogwheel train to the summit at Rigi-Kulm
(1,800m). Incredible vistas, typical Swiss farmhouses, and hundreds of
cows with bells will surprise one throughout the trip. Reward on going
to top is magnificent panorama of Alpine peaks crowding around the
convoluted contours of Lake Lucerne. While going up it was a nice
weather but slowly &amp;amp; slowly it started getting dark.</description></item><item><title>Mount Titlis - 21st June</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-16-mount-titlis-21st-june/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2006 12:52:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-16-mount-titlis-21st-june/</guid><description>Staying at Sachin’s place at Zurich was just to save our 3 night’s hotel
expense. After lot of discussion &amp;amp; surfing internet we came to final
decision that on 4th day of our trip we will go to Mount
Titlis via Luzern in order to
make best use of our Swiss flexi pass.
On boarding the train from Luzern to Engelberg we realized that it’s
more of Desi train. From train station, routes are well marked for
heading towards Mount Titlis where one can see all Mr.</description></item><item><title>Glacier Express - 20th June</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-16-glacier-express-20th-june/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2006 11:26:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-16-glacier-express-20th-june/</guid><description>Today we got up very early to take a quick trip of city as we did wanted
to go back to snow clad beauty of Switzerland instead of its
Mediterranean lake shores. But before having a heavy breakfast, we took
a promenade in the park along lake shore where there are lots of open
sculptors from Dada
movement. After we
took funicular ride to Madonna del Sasso.
We were determined to take glacier express from Andermatt to St.</description></item><item><title>Lausanne -18th June</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-15-lausanne-18th-june/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2006 14:08:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-15-lausanne-18th-june/</guid><description>Alors , trip started on Sunday morning 18th for Lausanne from Paris with
out any plan for next 7-8 days to be done in Swiss. On Friday and
Saturday we made few calls to our friends to get an idea about the top
attractions in the Switzerland. Santanu got some print out from work
MySwitzerland.com about Post Bus.
He reluctantly noted one hotel address for Interlaken and booked one B&amp;amp;B
for Sunday night around Lausanne.</description></item><item><title>Post Bus - 19th June</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-15-post-bus-19th-june/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2006 14:08:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2006-07-15-post-bus-19th-june/</guid><description>Till we are not sure what would be our next destination for today. The
nearest attraction is Montreaux, but that being so close to Lausanne we
were discussing to keep it for last day. After taking a hearty breakfast
we reached railway station. We asked at the information desk about the
Swiss travel pass and Post Bus.
Traveling with yellow Swiss post bus system is really breath taking
experience as they connect any place in Switzerland which can’t be
reached by train.</description></item><item><title>Le Marche</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2006-06-04-le-marche/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jun 2006 12:10:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2006-06-04-le-marche/</guid><description>The open markets in Paris have been
in existence since ages. It&amp;rsquo;s here that you find freshly picked fruit
and vegetables, fresh fish from Brittany and Normandy, meat, flowers,
farmhouses cheeses, breads – you name it &amp;hellip; its there. Food controls
are very strict in France and be assured of their quality and
cleanliness of preparation. French understands the quality in life and
nothing demonstrates this better than the wonderful food markets in
Paris.</description></item><item><title>Bike Route</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2006-05-23-bike-route/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2006 17:33:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2006-05-23-bike-route/</guid><description>Just uploaded few
pictures from my
bike route as promised in earlier
post. There is a
movie which I tried to shoot while riding with my digital camera (which
is quite old now). Last weekend was very rainy and stormy so being at
home tried MPG4 and QuickTime. MOV version is around 7 MB but the
quality is so so while QuickTime version of the same is big around 26MB
with better quality.</description></item><item><title>Changing face of India</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2006-04-25-changing-face-of-india/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2006 13:41:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2006-04-25-changing-face-of-india/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;India is changing&amp;rdquo; I am sure this is not a new topic to talk about. But
there are few things which got changed in India which my RADAR didn&amp;rsquo;t
notice before. I am not going to debate on their pros and cons. Any
changes are more noticeable when we encounter the same old place or
person after a break. Like you meet up an old friend with whom you grew
up but that time probably you did not noticed he or she was growing
vertically and your mid- aged relatives were growing horizontally.</description></item><item><title>Back to Mordor</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2006-04-20-back-to-mordor/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2006 09:56:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2006-04-20-back-to-mordor/</guid><description>Well it has been a long time I bloged. I am back to Paris; Pamela will
join me in a month time. The title of the post could not be better as I
am missing the sun after returning from India. I like rain after very
hot summer or sunny days with cool breeze. I really can not take those
dark cloudy days which makes me feel gloomy. As looking out of my window
can&amp;rsquo;t even make out is it 11 AM or 3 PM.</description></item><item><title>Tibx Shoe Laces</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2005-10-20-tibx-shoe-laces/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2005 18:29:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2005-10-20-tibx-shoe-laces/</guid><description>Yes these are my dirty shoes.

Cordoba first. But later friends who had been there suggested
visiting Cordoba.
We walked from our hotel on the busy morning streets of Seville to reach
the train station. We bought ticket for AVE (fast train) to Cordoba. The
fair is not at all expensive compared to French standard as it costs
almost similar from Paris CDG airport to city center.</description></item><item><title>Vienna - Austria</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2005-05-20-vienna-austria/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2005 18:10:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2005-05-20-vienna-austria/</guid><description>We just finished uploading pictures from our Vienna trip to our site. It
was a great trip. Only complain was the hotel which was really outside
of city without any proper public transport. The hotel was “Novotel” and
we preferred it as we got good treatment from this hotel chain for our
trips to Amsterdam and Berlin. When we booked the same it was mentioned
it has Metro next to it.</description></item><item><title>Itlay revisited</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2004-06-05-itlay-revisited/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jun 2004 12:59:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2004-06-05-itlay-revisited/</guid><description>We have been to Rome for 4 days in 2003 but we wanted to visit the other
parts of Italy but could not do that due to time constrain. We were

Its one year that we got married,the year was quite eventful
for both of us. On this day we went to Ramkrishna
Mission.The
hour long train ride to outskirts of Paris was very scenic with fall
color.Winter was breathing on our neck with its chilly wind. Durga Pooja

Salon du Chocolate.

was a very attractive deal by Ryan Air to Stockholm.We went there middle
of August when Paris was burning with summer heat. It was a great escape
to Scandinavia. Stockholm was very clean and very beautiful. Although,
the weather was not at its best as it rained for first two days.
We stayed in the centre of Stockholm (Drottninggatan) one side of this
pedestrian street with full of shops.</description></item><item><title>London 5days (July 29th - Aug 3rd)</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2003-08-11-london-5days-july-29th-aug-3rd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2003 23:21:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2003-08-11-london-5days-july-29th-aug-3rd/</guid><description>We went to London the proper Bilayet (Foreign land -as mentioned by
S.Rushdie ) for five days. We stayed as guest of Sampath, at his home
bit outside of London. The trip would not have been so pleasant and
memorable without his help and warm hospitality.
We reached around noon at Waterloo station by Eurostar. After keeping
our luggage at cloak room we went straight to London Eye. It was a
nice start to see all the monuments of London from birds view.</description></item><item><title>Heat wave of August</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2003-08-08-heat-wave-of-august/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2003 22:45:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2003-08-08-heat-wave-of-august/</guid><description>Oh! summer, it reached 40 degree cel. or 100+ F this week at Paris.The
global pollution is taking its effect may be? 20 years back it used to
snow a lot in Paris but now it does not snow any more. The houses,
metro&amp;rsquo;s are not designed for this kind of hot weather which makes it
more unbearable. We are surviving with Pedestal Fan but it is still far
from a rain.</description></item><item><title>Cantal</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2003-07-18-cantal/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2003 10:27:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2003-07-18-cantal/</guid><description>The first trip to France countryside was to Cantal -central region for 3
days with Murali &amp;amp; Joydeep on July 14th. Cantal, in France&amp;rsquo;s Massif
Central, is the largest volcanic edifice in Europe. We went by car,
Murali did a wonderful job by seating at the back of steering wheel &amp;amp;
Joydeep at navigator’s seat while we two were enjoying sleeping (from
time to time) at back seat. We enjoyed a natural landscape which was
really worth seeing through own eyes- rolling hills, lush green
farmlands, small mountains, forests &amp;amp; valleys.</description></item><item><title>Visiting Paris a Desi Guide</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2003-06-06-visiting-paris-a-desi-guide/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2003 21:01:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2003-06-06-visiting-paris-a-desi-guide/</guid><description>Me and Pamela are living in Paris for a while now and we are still
