      <description>Woke up at 4:25 AM ; it was supposed it be a a long day for me as I tryto run 39 KM practice run in a easy pace. Though I am not going toparticipate in the upcoming SCMM (Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon)2015 I decided to stick with the full marathoner group to see howgrueling their preparation can be. Assembled at 4:45 in front of the NCBS gate and met an ultra marathonerfrom our running group who already covered 23KM starting from 02:30 AM.</description>

      <description>Was looking for a simple instant coffee cake recipe and after readingfew here and there, zeroed on this one fromNestlé.But as usual did not had many things at home and being a weekend decidedto go with what ever had and make a simple sponge cake with coffeeflavor. Very surprised how simple and tasty it came out being a coffeelover would try it again :) Had a disastrous start when mixed baking powder and baking soda in thewet mix of butter and sugar.</description>
