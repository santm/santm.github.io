      <description>There are plenty of places to explore in Tuscan region from Florence asday trip. We decided to visit Siena which is only one hour. Reasonfor choosing Siena was for its medieval beauty; in that era Siena andFlorence were at war when Florence defeated Siena.
Travel by road through Tuscan region is really amazing as you crossthose post-card hills. But exhausted from yesterdays walking on thecobble stone roads of Florence I dozed as soon we hit the highway thatmade Santanu bit furious as he couldnâ€™t share those moments.</description>
