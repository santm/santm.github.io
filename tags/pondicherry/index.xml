after one and half year we went for a long weekend out of Bangalore; our
very first road trip of 2010. We were looking for something near to
beach and thought of heading towards Pondichery but due to
unavailability of any sea facing hotel we opted of Auroville.
Certain thing really happens for good. The road was Bangalore -&amp;gt; Krishnagiri -&amp;gt;
Tiruvanamalli -&amp;gt;Tindivanam-&amp;gt; Auroville.As usual Santanu had production outage @ work and went to sleep around 2
AM thanks to ‘new era new tool’ at work.</description></item></channel></rss>
