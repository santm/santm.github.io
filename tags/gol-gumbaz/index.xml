night. Had mu bath and got little bit packing down to ensure we leave
Bijapur at the earliest. Woke Pamela &amp;amp; Aarush around 5:30 and we started
to walk to Gol Gumbaz. Unfortunately the lady who manages the ticket
counter did not show up till 6:30. We were the first one to enter. After
the local guard gving us little more history lesson asked us to climb
the steps quickly before anyone.</description></item></channel></rss>
