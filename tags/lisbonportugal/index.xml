were at the very last phase of our vacation. We took train back to
Madrid tonight as from there we had our flight back to Paris.
We booked the train ticket long back; I went in-person to get the same
from Spanish Railway ticket office based in Paris. The office is kind of
hidden by all the stores near to Boulevard Haussmann; ever busy shopping
place.
Being Indian it was a really something new although we had experienced
few other different night trains in Europe.</description></item><item><title>Lisbon - Portugal</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2005-05-28-lisbon-portugal/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 May 2005 18:55:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2005-05-28-lisbon-portugal/</guid><description>Well the over night bus journey between Seville and Lisbon was not very
long one. We had an hour long stop as soon as we entered Portugal. The
road condition was good and we reached the Oriental Stop of Lisbon at
very early hours and the sky was still dark. From there it took another
20 minutes or so to reach the final destination near Zoological Garden.
We took a taxi and the ride was a short one to our hotel for only 6
Euros.</description></item></channel></rss>
