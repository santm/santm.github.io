We decided
to go for Jurong bird park and offbeat track -Kong Meng San Phor
Kark See Monastery, is the largest monastery in Singapore.
We had breakfast at ChatterBox as the normal breakfast side was packed.
The menu was quite different from the normal side as we had lots of
traditional dishes to choose from. As usual Pamela had lots of dim-sum
and I preferred the usual cereal and fruits.</description></item></channel></rss>
