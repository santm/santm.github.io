And magnificent beasts
Live with grace
In a Happy place
The JUNGLE is the best place.
Where tigers growl
Squirrel squeak You&amp;rsquo;ll hear heavenly tunes.
Waterfalls roaring
Trees are clapping
Gentle buzzing in the stream
the forest my home I will never leave it.</description></item><item><title>A Paradise</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2020-04-09-a-paradise-poem/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2020 20:48:39 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2020-04-09-a-paradise-poem/</guid><description>2019 August 22nd @ Bangalore I was sitting on a train to paradise.
I exited with my luggage in the midst of midnight with wobbly legs,
I felt like an old soldier with battle fatigue who just came back home.
The end was near, I hauled a cab &amp;amp; into the resort I went.
I was led to a room &amp;amp; immediately bed I went.
So tired, I was asleep before the pillow touched my head.</description></item><item><title>Chamleon</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2020-04-01-chamleon-by-aarush/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 11:35:30 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2020-04-01-chamleon-by-aarush/</guid><description>2020 February 22nd @ Bangalore Slippery, scaly reptilian.
Reptile in general, sniper in nature
eats victims for dinner.
Hunted by poachers
but valued by farmers.
For eliminating pesky pestering pests
weapon of choice is its own tongue;
Must have marksman ship for degree.
Could you guess the animal?
Not a monster,
It is a hidden chameleon.</description></item><item><title>Falcon</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2020-04-01-falcon-by-aarush/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 11:34:56 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2020-04-01-falcon-by-aarush/</guid><description>2020 February 22nd @ Bangalore Claws sharp &amp;amp; eyes wide
looking for target present on site.
You may think this to be a sniper
but its your neighborhood falcon.
This good boy is quite under appreciated
killing soldiers of nether word.
Who destroy grain and plunder world into disease
RATS, soldiers of satan
meet their end with this formidable warrior
But is he a hero to mankind
while his species face extinction.</description></item><item><title>Bats</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2020-04-01-bats-by-aarush/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 11:34:45 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2020-04-01-bats-by-aarush/</guid><description>2020 February 15th @ Calcutta Not your cricket bat nor your baseball bat
but just your friendly animal bat.
Better known as the carrier of disease &amp;amp; death
but is he the black savior of the human kind.
Think again what it can do friend.
Ravages real vampires to the end
mosquitoes everyone till they are in grave.
Killing pestering pests &amp;amp; insects.
Saves 3.5 billion dollars because it does the same thing as the pesticide.</description></item></channel></rss>
