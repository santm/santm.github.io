Google. on my Blackberry. All I needed was
data access enabled phone to download G-phone. The speculation was
running high about a new hardware from Google in lots of web sites. Lets
see how these applications (Gmail, Google maps, Google news, Google
search, Gtalk, Google calender) will work on a normal phone where the
display is not as big as Blackberry and you do not have full keyboard or
track wheel.</description></item><item><title>Envy me if you can !</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2006-05-04-envy-me-if-you-can/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2006 11:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2006-05-04-envy-me-if-you-can/</guid><description>This is about my commute to work nowadays when weather is graceful with
me and I ride to work. I hope it can not be better than this. Crossing
the most green part (there are loooooots of green bucks around as
well) of PARIS on a bike.
I leave you to explore the rest from Google map. I am sure you will have
fun. If I compare this with people in Bay-Area (CA), New-York or
Bangalore, Delhi I think people will envy me.</description></item></channel></rss>
