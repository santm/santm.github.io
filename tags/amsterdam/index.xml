      <description>Seeing one of friend&amp;rsquo;s photographs we were so excited to visit thatplace. That, in our last trip to Amsterdam (May 2003) we tried to visitthat - but alas! Local people told us that Tulip season is already over.But deep down in our heart we wanted to visit that place particularlyKeukenhof thinking -maybe next year.
Then we were in touch with Holland tourism in-order to know more aboutKeukenhof.</description>

      <description>Our first trip in Europe, I decided about Amsterdam because of tworeason Van Gogh and people of Amsterdam. To our delight it was reallygreat and was a great escape from noise and crowd of Paris.The city isnot so big compared to Paris but very clean and friendly. As mosttourist books suggest Dutch people has unique and very efficientsolution to their day-to-day problem. The streets are not crowded withcar.</description>
