      <description>A journey of sharing photo only got me into having a website of my own.When digital camera came out with decent mega pixel was an early adapterof the same. But soon realized sharing Pictures on email was not anoption and hosted pictures on Tripod. Oh! they used to give 10MB offree hosting :) now Flicker gives one 1TB free. So long story smallafter the managing own gallyery app writen initally with csv and php ,later mysql and php and lastly Gallery for almost 10 years.</description>
