Santanu already left for
office while we were in sleep. Around noon we went out of hotel to
nearby mall. Today I was not much interested in exploring rather looking
for kids activities. Spent almost half day at Toys R Us play area in
Paragon mall where Aarush enjoyed to fullest. He did not want to
give-up the car and was seating there for hours.</description></item></channel></rss>
