      <description>A four letter word of our modern consumerism; like all other 4 letterswords this is very commonly used.
The first time I was introduced to this was back in USA on Labor Dayweekend (1st week of September-’98). In US, every long weekendbrings a SALE. Size of weekend supplement of news-paper increaseswith advertisement from cars to toys. Not only that even you getconstant reminder from Macy’s to Wal-mart on your radio while you driveyour car.</description>

      <description>In India retail sector is growing like mushrooms especially in metrosuburbs. Everybody is in this rat race; recently heavy weightWal-Mart joined to open their stores in India and even reliance isnow trying to negotiate with france based global retail majorCarrefour (which is in air ). Some of the new retail stores aresmall and right around the corner competing with family owned generationold style grocery store.</description>
