      <description>Theweather looked gloomy with an overcast sky as we woke up. We hadbreakfast at the hotel and decided to visit Rishikesh today. Again weheaded back the way we came yesterday and after crossing Rajaji NationalPark the road divides and one goes towards to Dehradun and one toRishikesh. The drive was pleasant, as we opted Laxman Jhula as ourdestination google map smartly took us via highway bypassing the maincity.</description>
