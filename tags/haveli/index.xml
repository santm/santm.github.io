to hotel is another headache if you don’t have pick-up service
particularly at wee hours. We didn&amp;rsquo;t had that service from hotel as it
was extra 100INR so on reaching station we found, 10 people surrounded
us even they don’t allow couples to talk among themselves. Finally
hired one for 40 INR to go to Deoki Niwas hotel. When we reached, we
literally had to wake them up.</description></item><item><title>Shekhawati - Open Air Art Gallery</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2010-11-19-shekhawati-open-air-art-gallery/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2010 17:17:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2010-11-19-shekhawati-open-air-art-gallery/</guid><description>29th Oct - We took SpiceJet flight to Jaipur but unfortunately could
not make it within time due to technical problems and traffic congestion
we were made to wait for 3 hrs inside flight. We reached around 22:00 to
our pre-booked Hotel Madhuban by prepaid taxi.
On reaching hotel driver says &amp;ldquo;kya bekar hotel liya hain sir&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;.ughh.
Lump in my throat as all booking was done by me. It was a laborious,
monotonous job going through website after website, jotting down details
regarding price.</description></item></channel></rss>
