      <description>Day â€“ 1, As planned we left Bangalore quite late in our standardafter a big breakfast at home around 11, the traffic on a Saturday asusual was very heavy and it continued that way till we crossedNelamangala. After that the traffic got better but there were too manydiversions as there was work going on to build flyovers and roadwidening on NH-4. We filled fuel somewhere after Nelamangala, andnoticed there were not many decent stops like CCD or others.</description>
