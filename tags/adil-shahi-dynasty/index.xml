night. Had mu bath and got little bit packing down to ensure we leave
Bijapur at the earliest. Woke Pamela &amp;amp; Aarush around 5:30 and we started
to walk to Gol Gumbaz. Unfortunately the lady who manages the ticket
counter did not show up till 6:30. We were the first one to enter. After
the local guard gving us little more history lesson asked us to climb
the steps quickly before anyone.</description></item><item><title>Badami and Bijapur</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2013-01-02-badami-and-bijapur/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jan 2013 01:43:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2013-01-02-badami-and-bijapur/</guid><description>Day-4, Morning we woke up early and headed towards to Bansankari
Temple to start our day. Bansankari has lady idol with eight hands which
is worshiped meticulously around. We saw one lady rolling herself around
the whole temple periphery with wet cloth which signifies she just took
a bath in the nearby holy-pond. We got a good darshan of the devi idol
as there was not much crowd in the morning.</description></item></channel></rss>
