It was the day to visit china town and particularly Buddha tooth
relic temple. The day was very bright with little could in the sky.
This is the view from our hotel room looking central Singapore Business
District.
After a good breakfast headed out of hotel. Got down by MRT at China
town &amp;amp; took exit to Pagoda street. One can&amp;rsquo;t miss the colorful row of
shop-houses along that street, with baby blue and yellow flowers painted
all over.</description></item></channel></rss>
