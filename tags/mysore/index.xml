really a grueling month for both of us. For this I too was not getting
some time off from “Our little one”. There was absolute need of one
break. Santanu suddenly said two days before last exam that he is having
leave and if interested then we can go somewhere near by. Then he only
started reading on net and ended up saying we would go to
WAYANAD- Northern region of Kerala.</description></item><item><title>Road trip to Mysore</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2009-02-17-road-trip-to-mysore/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2009 04:58:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2009-02-17-road-trip-to-mysore/</guid><description>Applied for a whole week off in December as I had 25+ days off to
take for year 2008 - this gave us 9 days off with two weekends. I
preferred a week before Christmas to avoid traffic and tourist.
Initial plan was to leave Bangalore on Sunday for Mysore and move
from there depending on Aarush&amp;rsquo;s comfort. Stepping out of the home with
him means a disrupted routine and adapting to a new environment for all
us.</description></item></channel></rss>
