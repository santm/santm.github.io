meetings at work; best part is now a new Starbucks at Science Park
Drive is opened close to work; was very lucky where every other day got
pampered by my host with a coffee.
The flight from Bangalore was a nightmare I never experienced such
horrible service from any airline in my travel history. For Airlines
each seats are perishable commodities, which is lost as soon as the
flight takes off and it is a dream come true for Airline Company when
they have one.</description></item></channel></rss>
