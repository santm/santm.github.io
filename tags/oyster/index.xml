It was a sudden plan and I was tagged along with my instructor who
in-turn was invited by a local Singaporean colleague after work for
dinner. It was buffet for a fixed price at Marina Bay Shopping Mall.
The crowd was very young far-eastern or North-Asians. Sorry guys, I
could not figure out who is Chinese, Japanese, Koreans or just
Singaporeans…as they all looked alike and age-wise they looked like high
school or college students to me.</description></item><item><title>St. Michel</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2004-02-14-st-michel/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2004 22:05:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2004-02-14-st-michel/</guid><description>Perched on a rocky islet in the midst of vast sandbanks exposed to
powerful tides between Normandy and Brittany (on the north coast of
France) stand the &amp;lsquo;Wonder of the West&amp;rsquo;, a Gothic-style abbey dedicated
to the Archangel St Michael
It was built in 8thcentury, the buildings of Mont St. Michel
were constructed of granite which were carried from near-by island but
