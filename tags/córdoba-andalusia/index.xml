      <description>When we started planning for Andalusia we did not thought ofCordoba first. But later friends who had been there suggestedvisiting Cordoba.
We walked from our hotel on the busy morning streets of Seville to reachthe train station. We bought ticket for AVE (fast train) to Cordoba. Thefair is not at all expensive compared to French standard as it costsalmost similar from Paris CDG airport to city center.</description>
