capture the fountain of Place de la Concordein a very beautiful sunny morning. It is
so amazing that we still take pictures of Paris like tourist on their
first day. When we left home it was cloudy and we were questioning
ourselves why we are carrying the camera with us. But luckily it was
worth to do so. Then from there we took a small promenade at the garden
of Elysee.</description></item></channel></rss>
