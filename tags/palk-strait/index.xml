in Madurai. Breakfast at the hotel was quite elaborate and we did a good
one before starting for Rameshwaram. The hotel guys were kind enough
to give us elaborate maps which really helped us to exit Madurai without
asking for any direction. One thing we noticed in Tamil-Nadu the
direction boards are mostly in Tamil and less of English compared to
Karnataka.</description></item></channel></rss>
