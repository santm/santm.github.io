      <description>Freshened up to kick start our day and decided to go through past ofGermany. Took metro and got off at Potsdamer platz. Had coffee atStarbucks just outside the metro exit as it was too cold.
From here we walked to Checkpoint Charlie - a crossing point betweenEast and West Germany during the Cold War and Berlin Wall Memorial.The scenes blur as present dissolves into the past. Images flash throughour mind of 1989 when news flashed with headlines of demolition ofBerlin wall.</description>

      <description>Time to say Ciao, a presto (bye, see u soon) to Venice!!! Althoughwe knew it might never be soon again. With a happy mood, we left forMilan from where we started our memorable journey. We boarded Euro-starfor which we had to make an advance reservation. Indisputably it was thebest train we boarded in last seven days. On reaching Milan kept ourluggage in lock room and set off to explore the business city as wellfashion center of Italy.</description>

      <description>While categorizing our old travelogs I found there was no post onBelgiumwhich values a lot for me. As I go down the memory lane&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;year 2003,within 2 ½ months of marriage we have to move to Paris from US which wasa big change for me. Apart from the cultural shock, language was immensebarrier for day today life as well to mingle up with people around. Notonly that, in Indian arrange marriage, it takes time to understand eachother with each one&amp;rsquo;s weaknesses and failings.</description>

      <description>Continuing from my last post I like to share a great experience I had.It was a sudden plan and I was tagged along with my instructor whoin-turn was invited by a local Singaporean colleague after work fordinner. It was buffet for a fixed price at Marina Bay Shopping Mall.The crowd was very young far-eastern or North-Asians. Sorry guys, Icould not figure out who is Chinese, Japanese, Koreans or justSingaporeans…as they all looked alike and age-wise they looked like highschool or college students to me.</description>

      <description>A four letter word of our modern consumerism; like all other 4 letterswords this is very commonly used.
The first time I was introduced to this was back in USA on Labor Dayweekend (1st week of September-’98). In US, every long weekendbrings a SALE. Size of weekend supplement of news-paper increaseswith advertisement from cars to toys. Not only that even you getconstant reminder from Macy’s to Wal-mart on your radio while you driveyour car.</description>

      <description>I took this picture last Sunday; when I tried to kill my boring rainyafternoon with a cup of coffee at Starbucks. There is a big projectto make Singapore full with Hot-Spots; currently it is in BETA testingmode and all you need to do is sign-up with Sing-Tel or StarHub orM1(not sure) the three main Wireless provider ; the back-end services isprovided by iCell and Qmax networks.</description>

      <description>This picture was taken from my phone camera when I went to do our weeklyvegetable shopping in APMC [Agro Product Market] close to Vashi.Prices for every vegetables went up. Due to lack of infrastructure itwas a shame to see so much wastage due to heavy rain. From the postureof the seller it was quite clear he was not looking for lot of customersas he stretches his back.</description>

      <description>The open markets in Paris have beenin existence since ages. It&amp;rsquo;s here that you find freshly picked fruitand vegetables, fresh fish from Brittany and Normandy, meat, flowers,farmhouses cheeses, breads – you name it &amp;hellip; its there. Food controlsare very strict in France and be assured of their quality andcleanliness of preparation. French understands the quality in life andnothing demonstrates this better than the wonderful food markets inParis.</description>

      <description>While browsing through web sites for summer travel deals I found therewas a very attractive deal by Ryan Air to Stockholm.We went there middleof August when Paris was burning with summer heat. It was a great escapeto Scandinavia. Stockholm was very clean and very beautiful. Although,the weather was not at its best as it rained for first two days.
We stayed in the centre of Stockholm (Drottninggatan) one side of thispedestrian street with full of shops.</description>
