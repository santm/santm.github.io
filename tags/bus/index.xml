      <description>Living in Paris and not travelling in Metro has lots of demerits. Likeusual I am going to start with the traffic jams, one way roads,unavailability of parking, high parking tickets and very unusual senseof Parisian driving skills.
These only list if you have a car and travelling of your own. But whatabout those who are taking other mode of smart transports like Bus,Tram, Bicycle, Rollerblade or just walk to work or work from home?</description>
