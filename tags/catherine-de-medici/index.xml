It had always
major importance to France. In the Medieval time or the best time of
French civilization French Rules and noble men of that time had built
lot of Chateau (castles) along this river. It is very close to Paris,
which is one of the reasons to built their weekend home for hunting and
relaxation here.
We only visited three castles that Sunday.</description></item></channel></rss>
