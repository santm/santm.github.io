Next day we woke up leisurely had a wonderful breakfast . Our host
meticulously wrote down all the attractions near Madikeri. The list
included Tala-Cauvery â€“ birth place of river Kaveri, Raja seat,
Abby Falls, Omkareshwara Temple, Cauvery- Nisargadhama. We
decided for all except the last one as we wanted to take it easy and not
rushing between attractions.
As soon as we started driving to Madikeri (district headquarters of
Coorg) the real beauty of Coorg started to unveil itself.</description></item></channel></rss>
