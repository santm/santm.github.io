who are commonly seen at Indian Railway Station. They remind me of those
childhood days when they were part of our vacation (mass aviation is
still in infancy at India). They help to carry big over sized luggage
that Indian travelers travel with. As Indian travelers are not that
physically fit like westerners to lift their own luggage.</description></item></channel></rss>
