      <description>We initially planned to visit Bhutan during summer vacation of â€™13.Somehow during the planning phase we found it was overshooting ourbudget. And moreover, was advised against it during late April &amp;amp; EarlyMay as there is a high chances of rain during that time. So we had noplan and no places to visit while we are going to be in Siliguri for10/12 days.
We called one travel agent in Calcutta from train and told him about ourrequirement and he said he would be able to put an itinerary of 6 nights( 2nights Sikkim, 2 Kursuang and 2 in Darjeeling).</description>
