Team-BHP web site, specifically their
forum. And from then on is kind of hooked though not a car freak myself
with limited understanding for these electro-mechanical wonders. What
fascinates me is travelogue section of this forum. It is great to find
so many passionate souls sharing their trips and tricks. Last November
got an unexpected mail about a meet-up @ Yelagiri for Bangalore
team-bhpean; was not sure to join or not.</description></item></channel></rss>
