      <description>Just uploaded fewpictures from mybike route as promised in earlierpost. There is amovie which I tried to shoot while riding with my digital camera (whichis quite old now). Last weekend was very rainy and stormy so being athome tried MPG4 and QuickTime. MOV version is around 7 MB but thequality is so so while QuickTime version of the same is big around 26MBwith better quality.</description>
