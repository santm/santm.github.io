upcoming Hyderabad run which I am trying to be a regular member.
Normally the &amp;ldquo;numero uno&amp;rdquo; destination for hill training around Bangalore
is Nandi Hill ; which is 60KM north of the city. Have already run Nandi
hills few times and yes Nandi is grueling specially the last 3 KM. Nandi
run is 15KM in total where you go 7.</description></item></channel></rss>
