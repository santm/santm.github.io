      <description>Just saw this advertisement on BBC website while checking my morningdose of news. I was quite fascinated by this ad. Immediately started tothink “Oh this is great!!” now I can get a great coffee to start myday at home by pressing a button.
If you are not familiar with this machine or not a coffee person thismachine uses special coffee capsules to dispense coffee. There arevarieties of flavor to choose from and trust me it really makes greatcoffee.</description>
