      <description>My addiction to coffee is old an old one. My morning does not startwithout coffee on weekdays. I am not quite human still have mymorning coffee will probably describe it best. In India coffee is verydifferent from West. I came to know recently that Indian Coffee Boardis head quartered in Bangalore. The main coffee producing region ofIndia(hills of Coorg, Niligiris and Wayanad&amp;gt;) are not very far offBangalore.</description>

      <description>Just saw this advertisement on BBC website while checking my morningdose of news. I was quite fascinated by this ad. Immediately started tothink “Oh this is great!!” now I can get a great coffee to start myday at home by pressing a button.
If you are not familiar with this machine or not a coffee person thismachine uses special coffee capsules to dispense coffee. There arevarieties of flavor to choose from and trust me it really makes greatcoffee.</description>
