causes of mortality on the planet. 33 million people are HIV-positive in
the world, but 90 % of them ignore it. Given the numbers, there is a
definite need to increase the awareness levels about the disastrous
effects of this incurable disease.
I am sure there are plenty online about the same which can be accessed
quickly but the main problem remains in uneducated rural areas where it
is not even mentioned forget about a healthy discussion.</description></item><item><title>Aids Awareness - Paris</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2006-10-10-aids-awareness-paris/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2006 10:24:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2006-10-10-aids-awareness-paris/</guid><description>Can any one guess what this publicity is about? Well, this is 2006 anti
Aids campaign by city hall of Paris (Paris prot√®ge l&amp;rsquo;amour means
Paris protects love)
In the photo what we see is sunset on some historical building with moon
at backdrop, but when you take a close look moon is&amp;hellip; a condom. It aims
at promoting the use of condoms among the population i.e., to have safe
sex.</description></item></channel></rss>
