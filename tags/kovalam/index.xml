Moreover, my son got fractured elbow but then also our spirit was on
high although bit dampened that whether we will enjoy or not; kind of
excitement mixed with anxiety, hope and happiness. I still remember the
moment we sat in the car and started for the trip which was going to be
one of the longest drive with Aarush.</description></item><item><title>Kovalam and Varkala beach</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2012-08-14-kovalam-and-varkala-beach/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Aug 2012 14:46:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2012-08-14-kovalam-and-varkala-beach/</guid><description>Drive from Kanyankumari was smooth, Aarush took a small nap. The road
was undivided two lanes so the speed was limited but the lush green from
paddy field , coconut grove and plantation leaves was pleasant for eyes.
We reached Kovalam as per our plan, saw sunset which was magnificient.
It was great to watch perfect sunrise and sunset on a same day. Public
Beach was next to Taj and Leela hotels where large part belongs to them
for their private beach.</description></item></channel></rss>
