      <description>Love taking pictures with long shutter speed at night - technique isvery simple. All I needed was a tripod to secure camera from shakingwhile leaving the camera shutter open. I know this is not a greatpicture but that is what I got from my balcony. A better one withKharghar landmark Utsav Chowk is postedhere.</description>

      <description>Sunset with blue sky of late October seems “magnifique” along with openspace of Navi Mumbai as viewed from local train (picture taken throughwindow)
This one I clicked last Saturday when I was stuck in middle of JJFlyover - the longest flyover in Mumbai (2.3 KM). It is constructed likea snake, which makes its way through labyrinth of old buildings oneither side; basically you bypass the busy, crowded market underneath.</description>

      <description>This picture was taken from my phone camera when I went to do our weeklyvegetable shopping in APMC [Agro Product Market] close to Vashi.Prices for every vegetables went up. Due to lack of infrastructure itwas a shame to see so much wastage due to heavy rain. From the postureof the seller it was quite clear he was not looking for lot of customersas he stretches his back.</description>

      <description>It is four years that we got married :D and according to the namingconvention it is LinenAnniversary we have stillhave a long way to go before it will be any precious or strong material.
This day is special in another way as it is birthday of Prateek(maternal cousin of mine). Now we stay above floor from Prateek. Afterour wedding this is the first time that we three are together.</description>
