      <description>Last Saturday, it was father &amp;amp; son time again as Pamela in school aftera long summer vacation. Aarush was doing his part to keep my hands busyand asked him are you a Nut for being such naughty? And the apt replywas “Yes, I am; I am a coconut”. I could not stop laughing for along time. Even though we call it a nut but coconut is not a nutbotanically?</description>
