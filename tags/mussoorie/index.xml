      <description>Itwas a crazyweek,as usual, it always happens that the week is very bad forwork, commuteÂ andothers just before we go onvacation and come back. So somehow we finished our packing on Thursdaynight and set our alarms for early Friday.Wewoke up on time and got ready and then call for Uber, the app shows thetaxi is just next to our apartment where normally few Uber/Ola alwaysare found.</description>
