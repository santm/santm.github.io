      <description>Back from Cordoba around 4PM in the afternoon to Seville. We went to buyticket for next phase of journey that was between Seville and Lisbon.Oh! That was too hot and sweating experience to summarize in short. Backto hotel being boiled with afternoon heat we got freshen up.
We started our evening stroll starting from Puente de San Telmo towardsTriana around 9PM, the other side of the river a common Sevilleneighborhood.</description>
