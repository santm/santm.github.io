Indian Railway. The last time I traveled in 1stclass was
early 1985 when we went to Puri ( a must stop for Bengali
).
So when the dates for summer vacation became clear started booking for
train tickets. It was month of December when we booked ticked for April.
Wanted to book 2ndAC ticket but to my surprise it was
already sold out so opted for AC 1stClass.</description></item></channel></rss>
