Normally A is taken to doctor for monthly check-up once other then that
no outing for him. As he is considered too small for all these by my
parents. So they neither allow him nor me to go anywhere. After birth it
was third time when Aarush was taken out of the house to meet people
other then his doc&amp;rsquo;s clinic. Moreover because of weather it was
difficult for us to go anywhere.</description></item></channel></rss>
