Packed everything night before so that
after breakfast we can check-out without much wasting of time.It was
holiday at Singapore as of some Muslim festival. My plan was to go to
Arab Street. This area has beautiful old shop houses that line the
streets.Â 
The highlight of the area is the grand Sultan Mosque, which was
crowded as people were coming out after prayers.</description></item></channel></rss>
