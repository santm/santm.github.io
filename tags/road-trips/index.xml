The planning for the trip started almost a month back. It involved looking at Google maps multiple times and talking to few friends who are roadies. We knew the road till Hyderabad would be good as we been on this highway almost 2 years back. Beyond Hyderabad was a complete unknown. Also posted my na√Øve query to TEAM-BHP.</description></item><item><title>Onakona Temple</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2021-02-22-onakona-chhattisgarh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 02:02:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2021-02-22-onakona-chhattisgarh/</guid><description>Proluge
Somewhere sometime Pamela wrote down two places to explore in Chhattisgarh which were not that well known. And one of them was Onakona. She being from there, it intrigued us with the beutiful pictures. After a week in Durg we were looking for a small break, the week was hectic and top of it the whole Diwali weekend was super busy as domestic helps were on vacation for days.</description></item></channel></rss>
