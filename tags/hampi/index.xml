after a big breakfast at home around 11, the traffic on a Saturday as
usual was very heavy and it continued that way till we crossed
Nelamangala. After that the traffic got better but there were too many
diversions as there was work going on to build flyovers and road
widening on NH-4. We filled fuel somewhere after Nelamangala, and
noticed there were not many decent stops like CCD or others.</description></item><item><title>Road trip - October 2012</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2012-12-24-road-trip-october-2012/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Dec 2012 18:50:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2012-12-24-road-trip-october-2012/</guid><description>Visiting the northern part of Karnataka for its historic and artistic
monuments were long due. We thought of doing it two years back during
15th August long weekend but postponed the same due to late rain and
high water level at Tungabhadra Rivers. This year we started to plan
early and consulted two avid travelers and their guidance in setting up
the itinerary. It was planned that we would use the 2 weeks school
vacation for this trip, but then I personally felt it would be a great
miss Durga pooja twice in a row.</description></item></channel></rss>
