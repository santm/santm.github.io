      <description>My current home in India is Siliguri, north of West Bengal may notbe the most alluring for tourist destinations. But it is the mostimportant city in the entire Eastern Himalayas due to its geographicallocation. As city is unabashedly an industrial centre and gateway toseven sisters of North-East along with Sikkim &amp;amp; eastern part of Nepal.My parents moved here ten years back and by that time I had just startedmy career; never had ample holidays to explore any thing around.</description>
