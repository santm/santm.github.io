going to a big change from current gallery 2 and initial alpha release
did not have any migration path from gallery2. It was pushed to Beta
release after 2 alpha releases. but to my surprise I found it was
implemented in alpha 4 and here is the test result of a new neat code. I
am really liking the new compact code making gallery 3 faster and lean
compared to its predecessor.</description></item></channel></rss>
