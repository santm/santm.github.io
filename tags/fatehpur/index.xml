not make it within time due to technical problems and traffic congestion
we were made to wait for 3 hrs inside flight. We reached around 22:00 to
our pre-booked Hotel Madhuban by prepaid taxi.
On reaching hotel driver says &amp;ldquo;kya bekar hotel liya hain sir&amp;quot;&amp;hellip;.ughh.
Lump in my throat as all booking was done by me. It was a laborious,
monotonous job going through website after website, jotting down details
regarding price.</description></item></channel></rss>
