Running and
walked around Paris last week.
New in gallery - bibs from running . Well you must be wondering what is
that ? For a person like me from whom the activity of sport was taken
away by various pressures at young age it means a lot. The good side of
it is that I am the very few fortunate one to run at this age at various
places but rest remains as silent voice in vast population of India.</description></item><item><title>Metro in Paris</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2005-11-29-metro-in-paris/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2005 09:52:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2005-11-29-metro-in-paris/</guid><description>Living in Paris and not travelling in Metro has lots of demerits.

usual I am going to start with the traffic jams, one way roads,
unavailability of parking, high parking tickets and very unusual sense
of Parisian driving skills.
These only list if you have a car and travelling of your own. But what
about those who are taking other mode of smart transports like Bus,
Tram, Bicycle, Rollerblade or just walk to work or work from home?</description></item></channel></rss>
