      <description>Well after all these years of self hosting and WordPress I am kind oflet go the Self-hosting. Movedpamela.santm.com to Tumblr and all thepictures from Gallery3 toFlickr. Still need to move www.santm.com somewhere and aarush.santm,com picturesto somewhere, most likely it will be Flickr again. hope to complete theall these before 2013 finishes.</description>

      <description>Installed all these three on pamela.santm.com and blog.santm.com whichare running on wordpress 3.6 trunk. moved the dns details to cloudflare.While Pamela&amp;rsquo;s hobby site did very well Google page test result our blogresult was not great. Looks like the culprit is inbuilt gallery ofwordpress which is re-sizing images and seving them on fly causing highserver time. the command that helped me a lot is &amp;ldquo;mogrify -strip *.</description>

      <description>I just found out d-atmosphere.com is holding a competition where theyare offering a free wordpress theme called WPRemix. It’s a very nice theme with loadsof features.
The rule is simple - just write about the competition in your blog andpost your link back in the comments on the contest page.

      <title>Skittlish Theme with Silk Icons for Wordpress</title>

      <description>Trying to jazz up skittlish theme ofwordpresswith silk icon sets fromfamfamfam.com.In recent time there is new version of skittlish supporting widgets so Ithought it might be a god starting ground. Best part - for few colors(red, orange, green &amp;amp; blue) there are icons available for tag, user(author). But for rest there is none. As I am not a graphic person notsure how should I go forward.</description>

      <description>Just upgraded to the latest beta trunk of wordpress 2.2(bleeding) andfound myself with unrecoverable errors. Realized wordpress incorporatedtagging within the core but the old faithful Ultimate Tag Warrior doesnot work any more :( Found another bug-hunt has started and hope for tag import from (UTW)till then …… have to live with out tags Sigh!</description>

      <title>Mera Bharat Jawaan</title>

      <description>Another funny advertisement which caught my attention Budda Hoga TeraBaap. This is a soft or hard slang depending on your view - &amp;ldquo;May beyour father is old&amp;rdquo; This new TV series name is &amp;ldquo;Mera BharatJaawan&amp;rdquo; which translates into &amp;ldquo;My India is Young&amp;rdquo;. With one fourthpopulation under the age of 25 India definitely has young demography.
P.S - In last two months, I have changed theme for wordpress (blog) atleast four times.</description>

      <description>Well another day! Some techie note ; upgraded the web site to the latestbeta release of Wordpress. And I found some strange behaviour. This iswhat I put forward to the mailing list. But with few minute of researchfound the root cause.
WP is adding [code]
[/code] as extra inside in my [code]
[/code]This was one example.[code]
[/code]
It was happening due to &amp;ldquo;wp-include/formatting.php&amp;rdquo;. I use plaintext mode while doing copy-paste between text-editor from my PC toWordpress Editor.</description>

      <description>Migrated to Wordpress along withGallery2, the choice for the same was noteasy. As for a long time Mambo and customhome grown Photo Album was doing the job fine. In fact the template Iused for the same was appreciated by friends. But as days passed andnumbers of pictures are growing it was getting difficult to manage thesame with custom gallery. But the idea to grab Wordpress and droppingMambo is a personal one.</description>
