      <description>As you know the growth of mobile is one of BIG discussion point of anytechnology seminar or talk show you attend today. Everybody alreadypredicting more and more people will use mobile to accessinternet/information/e-commerce compared to traditional desktop orlaptop. And in a country like India there will be lots of users who willbe &amp;ldquo;on-line&amp;rdquo; for the first time and they will directly use a smartphone bypassing key-board and mice altogether, in numbers they might belarger than some European country.</description>

      <description>Installed all these three on pamela.santm.com and blog.santm.com whichare running on wordpress 3.6 trunk. moved the dns details to cloudflare.While Pamela&amp;rsquo;s hobby site did very well Google page test result our blogresult was not great. Looks like the culprit is inbuilt gallery ofwordpress which is re-sizing images and seving them on fly causing highserver time. the command that helped me a lot is &amp;ldquo;mogrify -strip *.</description>
