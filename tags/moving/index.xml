Bangalore. So compared to last moves it is going to be a very small
one. In 2003, we crossedÂ Atlantic (California to Paris), in 2006 we
crossed Indian ocean (Paris to Mumbai) and in 2008 we moved within India
(Mumbai to Bangalore). Now this is just 20 Km move within Bangalore
city.
The painters from Asian Paint Home Solutions are doing the paint job and
they are supposed to finish by 25th November.</description></item></channel></rss>
