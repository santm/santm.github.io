but just your friendly animal bat.
Better known as the carrier of disease &amp;amp; death
but is he the black savior of the human kind.
Think again what it can do friend.
Ravages real vampires to the end
mosquitoes everyone till they are in grave.
Killing pestering pests &amp;amp; insects.
Saves 3.5 billion dollars because it does the same thing as the pesticide.</description></item></channel></rss>
