It has three
prominent zones - Central, Western and Eastern.
Central Range &amp;ndash; This drive covers the central region of the park.
It is an ideal introduction to the park and its ecology as the route
passes through the entire spectrum of habitat types prevalent in the
Kaziranga area. (though Brahmaputra view is not available, a stretch of
the route goes by the tributary river Difloo) There is a possibility of
sighting elephants as well as the other big animals especially the swamp
buffalo and of course the rhino.</description></item><item><title>Day 1 in Kaziranga - April 2018</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2019-02-20-day-1-in-kaziranga-april-2018/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Feb 2019 15:04:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2019-02-20-day-1-in-kaziranga-april-2018/</guid><description>After a good night sleep with thunders and rain, the morning was clear
of rain but the sky had overcast. Without much delay, we put all our
stuff in the car and head out of the resort for Kaziranga. The best
thing about the resort for us its proximity to the highway. We drive on
the straight highway going east. The road was divided four lanes and
there was not much traffic and was cruising around 100KM/Hr.</description></item></channel></rss>
