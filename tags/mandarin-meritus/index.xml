      <description>Viewing Singapore through a lens of mother of 22 months old baby was notfun all the time but enjoyed our stay there for 9 days. Actually thisjourney is because of Santanu who went almost every year after returningto India. Each time after his official trip he use to complain about hisloneliness and etc. So this time we made sure to accompany him. But whata luck! he was damn busy in his office.</description>
