      <description>Almostafter one and half year we went for a long weekend out of Bangalore; ourvery first road trip of 2010. We were looking for something near tobeach and thought of heading towards Pondichery but due tounavailability of any sea facing hotel we opted of Auroville.Certain thing really happens for good. The road was Bangalore -&amp;gt; Krishnagiri -&amp;gt;Tiruvanamalli -&amp;gt;Tindivanam-&amp;gt; Auroville.As usual Santanu had production outage @ work and went to sleep around 2AM thanks to ‘new era new tool’ at work.</description>

      <description>I am finding it tricky as I try to compare my experiences and lifestyles that I encountered from two different continents. I do not knowif my readers will be able to understand me. Moreover, my recent journeyis an unusual one as most Indian travels east to west while I moved fromwest to east.
During my stay at Paris for last 3 and half years, most of my lunch atwork was at shared corporate cafeteria between three companies.</description>

      <description>Can any one guess what this publicity is about? Well, this is 2006 antiAids campaign by city hall of Paris (Paris protège l&amp;rsquo;amour meansParis protects love)
In the photo what we see is sunset on some historical building with moonat backdrop, but when you take a close look moon is&amp;hellip; a condom. It aimsat promoting the use of condoms among the population i.e., to have safesex.</description>

      <description>As we were leaving Paris it seems our friends (whom we knew for a shortwhile) has to give something as a memento. Gifts were extravagant andreally worth mentioning as they chose something which we adore.
To start with gift Pamela got from François is very special. I am sureshe can write a new post about the same. I am just going to give youbrief detail on the same.</description>

      <description>We moved from Paris to Bombay. Yes it is a big event in our life and weare still not sure whether things will fall in place at the end or not.We are trying our destiny – but we are not sure what will be there forus???????? Well lots of questions and raising eye-brows from friends andfamilies.
But this post is not about why we left Paris and why moved to India.</description>

      <description>This electronic device you are seeing in the picture is nothing but adoor code of our apartment where using a scroll buttons one has tosearch and select the name and then press “appel” means “call”button which will give a ring to the concerned persons apartment and itis that habitué who will answer that call &amp;amp; unlock the main door.
Certain buildings will have only code with rarely names on front doorsso without “Le code” you won&amp;rsquo;t get past the outer door which usuallyleads to a small inner courtyard or a stairway.</description>

      <description>From a good friend of mine I got an offer to help at backstage of RituBeri’s fashion show to be held at Paris on 5th July at Lido. Atfirst I wanted to deny this proposal but with second thought that itmight be a fun with friends to be there; I nodded my head giving myapproval. Ace fashion designer Ritu Beri is the first Asian to havejoined a French fashion house making a slow transition from Indian HauteCouture to Prêt-a-porter (ready to wear).</description>

      <description>Watched lots of movies, uploaded some photos toRunning andwalked around Paris last week.
New in gallery - bibs from running . Well you must be wondering what isthat ? For a person like me from whom the activity of sport was takenaway by various pressures at young age it means a lot. The good side ofit is that I am the very few fortunate one to run at this age at variousplaces but rest remains as silent voice in vast population of India.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Daney Daney Pey likha hain khaney waley kaa naam&amp;rdquo;- whichcolloquially means each grain has the name of the person who will eat it(it is the fortune of the person to have certain meal or not). Well thesame with more of spice in Hindi movies &amp;ldquo;goli goli pey likha hainmarney waley kaa naam&amp;rdquo; which means in each bullets it is written thename of the person who will die.</description>

      <description>Inmy salad days I used to hate many green veggies and I remember when maaused to scold me for the same. Somehow I didn’t had taste for them atthat point of time but gradually I developed the taste so much so that Ican now survive happily on those green things (cow-food).
From long time Santanu wanted to make a change on our meal as it seemswe both are putting on weight.</description>

      <description>Finally, world cup football came to an end where France lost to Italy.For me France lost but at same time Italy neither win as they justwaited for the final penalty shoot out to happen. I do not like the wayItalian play football in general. They make it dull and boring. Italianand their relation to non Italian footballer are well known. And thistime the whole nation is waiting for the verdict of match fixing inItalian league.</description>

      <description>Football - the definition for the same may be quite simple but itcertainly does have lots of colors. It is a mutli-billion dollarbusiness from sporting to TV companies. For some it is as close to theirreligion. People can fight or hug with a complete stranger whileignoring his family or close one when there is a match.
As we live in Europe it is very hard to escape it.</description>

      <description>After traveling to so many places in Europe in last three years now wewere thinking to travel to some other part of globe which can be easilyreached from Paris within few hours maybe somewhere in North African.The very thought came was how about going to Morocco or Egypt but noneof them was perfect weather wise to visit. Then also after too much ofthinking we settled for Morocco and started to gather touristicinformation.</description>

      <description>The open markets in Paris have beenin existence since ages. It&amp;rsquo;s here that you find freshly picked fruitand vegetables, fresh fish from Brittany and Normandy, meat, flowers,farmhouses cheeses, breads – you name it &amp;hellip; its there. Food controlsare very strict in France and be assured of their quality andcleanliness of preparation. French understands the quality in life andnothing demonstrates this better than the wonderful food markets inParis.</description>

      <description>Just uploaded fewpictures from mybike route as promised in earlierpost. There is amovie which I tried to shoot while riding with my digital camera (whichis quite old now). Last weekend was very rainy and stormy so being athome tried MPG4 and QuickTime. MOV version is around 7 MB but thequality is so so while QuickTime version of the same is big around 26MBwith better quality.</description>

      <description>Just another weekend of May in Paris. I don&amp;rsquo;t know any other time whenthe weather can be so beautiful with clear sky and warm temperature.Right now, all the horse chestnuttrees along wideboulevards are full of white flowers. This tree is also known asMarronier d&amp;rsquo;Inde, thanks to Francois for introducing the same.Truly, if one cheers up and forgets all the problems round him-it is aromantic experience in itself.</description>

      <description>I am not sure if you happened to experience a very low probabilitysituation or event in life which you can compare with winnnig alottery orgetting struck by thunder. Statistically the second one has more chance.To explain the same I take to you to recent past&amp;hellip;
I had that bizarre experience in the month on December while returningfrom work took abus.There was one gentleman very well groomed of dark complexion And I metthe same person next day (Saturday) in a differentbuswhile going out.</description>

      <description>This is about my commute to work nowadays when weather is graceful withme and I ride to work. I hope it can not be better than this. Crossingthe most green part (there are loooooots of green bucks around aswell) of PARIS on a bike.
I leave you to explore the rest from Google map. I am sure you will havefun. If I compare this with people in Bay-Area (CA), New-York orBangalore, Delhi I think people will envy me.</description>

      <description>Well it has been a long time I bloged. I am back to Paris; Pamela willjoin me in a month time. The title of the post could not be better as Iam missing the sun after returning from India. I like rain after veryhot summer or sunny days with cool breeze. I really can not take thosedark cloudy days which makes me feel gloomy. As looking out of my windowcan&amp;rsquo;t even make out is it 11 AM or 3 PM.</description>

      <description>Yes I am going to take vacations! It has been a while (after May 2005)when we went out from our current address in Paris. In our standard oftravelling it is a record for good or bad&amp;hellip;that can&amp;rsquo;t be said. May beit is the effect of **Chateau, Bateau, Gateau.**We would love to visitsome country-side or mountains now. But, unfortunately Pamela is not atall interested for any ski-trip as she is complaining about the Pariscold all the time.</description>

      <description>Well my French classes came to an end. And I passed the exam :D I wouldlike to take up the Oscar podium for few seconds and like to thank mybeloved wife Pamela for her support ; my teacher, my colleagues- Stephanand Fred for their time and effort to make me understand the basics ofFrench grammar. And I am very satisfied that I didn&amp;rsquo;t let them down as Iscored well in grammar and got all the Passé-compose andImparfait (past tense) correct.</description>

We were invited to one of my colleague’s place for the first time afteralmost 3 years in France for ‘Galette des rois’. It was verymemorable and an enjoyable evening.</description>

Yesterday, was last French class before 2 week vacations so we went outfor drinks after the class. I never had this kind of social events whereyou have to speak in French and you are not ashamed of your mistakes.</description>

      <description>Living in Paris and not travelling in Metro has lots of demerits. Likeusual I am going to start with the traffic jams, one way roads,unavailability of parking, high parking tickets and very unusual senseof Parisian driving skills.
These only list if you have a car and travelling of your own. But whatabout those who are taking other mode of smart transports like Bus,Tram, Bicycle, Rollerblade or just walk to work or work from home?</description>

May be I just deleted them(by mistake)!!! Yes I know the troubleof digital memories they are very easy to capture but most difficult tosave. There are lists of problem that can happen to your golden past;starting with the media card to Hard Drive not to mention virus problemsor accidental deletion of files</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Are you safe out there?&amp;rdquo; This was typical question to which I have beenanswering to my friends and relatives after the riots at Paris suburbs.I myself was keeping updated with news only. &amp;ldquo;Thank God&amp;rdquo; it looks likegetting better now. I would not like to make any comments and express myview on the same as it seems to be very complex matter.
We celebrated Diwali quite well this year.</description>

      <description>After a long time I was able tocapture the fountain of Place de la Concordein a very beautiful sunny morning. It isso amazing that we still take pictures of Paris like tourist on theirfirst day. When we left home it was cloudy and we were questioningourselves why we are carrying the camera with us. But luckily it wasworth to do so. Then from there we took a small promenade at the gardenof Elysee.</description>

      <description>After all these months, I prefer not to use years yet :) I startedformal French class. I am not sure how it will end up as it keeps mereminding about my Spanish class which I dropped out after 2 months. Butfor those 2 months I went on time to Foothill community college everymorning at 8AM. It was different as medium of instruction was Englishnow everything is French.</description>

      <description>Almost after one and half year I wasrunning in any event. The weather was very grey but it was very pleasantfor running. Temperature was around 16 degree Celsius. The race was 17KMlong starting from bottom of Eiffel Tower to Château deVersailles.For the first time, Pamela accompanied me to the starting point of thecourse so as to take a photo of mine with Eiffel Tower. The first partof the run was along River Seine and then it goes to Forest of Meudon;this was the most crucial part as it has a steep climb (approx.</description>

      <description>When I was on my vacation last week in Spain and Portugal, was thinkingabout to write down all that we had experienced there - the places wevisted and food we tasted and others. But back to work it is such aDilbert place that I can not explain with my logic.
Also I need to find a cheap solution to restore pictures from SmartMedia. It looks like there is a well suited option commercial for 40Euros.</description>

      <description>River Loire is one of the four major rivers of France. It had alwaysmajor importance to France. In the Medieval time or the best time ofFrench civilization French Rules and noble men of that time had builtlot of Chateau (castles) along this river. It is very close to Paris,which is one of the reasons to built their weekend home for hunting andrelaxation here.
We only visited three castles that Sunday.</description>

      <description>I have a fascination for the colour of autumn, mat be the reason is Inever experienced them before while in India and California. You canenjoy the same in Paris where trees along the big boulevards changes itcolour. Around Paris particularly the Bois de Boulogne is very nice thattime. We went to Versailles just to take pictures. It was not a verysunny day that Sunday, sun was playing around clouds.</description>

      <description>Going to opera for the first time was a very eye-opening experience. Itwas really fabulous and all the thanks goes to Francois for the same. Hegave us the recording in CD and printed storyline before. That reallyhelped us to enjoy and understand the musical drama. We went to theOpera Garnier the old one in Paris. He got us one of the best seats inthe beautiful opera house as the TV camera was in our next box.</description>

      <description>I wanted to take pictures of Paris famous landmarks in the twilight witha tripod. We started with Sacre-coeur Basilica. And the picture we gotfrom there was really great as we were there on the right time. The skycolor was perfect for the camera and it was just lighted.
From there we went to Moulin-Rouge; the famous cabaret of Paris then toAssembly National the French Parliament. We crossed Seine and came toConcord.</description>

Pamela wanted to visit this place last summer but some how Iwas able to save myself from that trip. This year I could not escape.OK, enough of cursing and all. At end I have to say, that I did enjoyedmy time there like every other time at Disneyland.</description>

      <description>This Museum is an extension of Louvre Museum-collection of objects fromAsia. Mostly the objects are from south Asia and far east Asia, if youbeen to London British Museum and visited Asian sections you will feeldeja vu. It is located in 16th arrondissement of Paris next to MetroStation of Iena.
We visited the same with Francois; it was only Francois who told usabout this museum. He had been here before few times.</description>

      <description>Oh! summer, it reached 40 degree cel. or 100+ F this week at Paris.Theglobal pollution is taking its effect may be? 20 years back it used tosnow a lot in Paris but now it does not snow any more. The houses,metro&amp;rsquo;s are not designed for this kind of hot weather which makes itmore unbearable. We are surviving with Pedestal Fan but it is still farfrom a rain.</description>

      <description>It was great that we just went there without any plan. Various kinds ofmusical instruments &amp;amp; on different themes were played by young studentmusicians. A nice place for free concert and music if you are aroundParis. We spent quite a long time. But, we could not attend the finalgrand Jazz program, as it was already around 9 PM.

It was birth anniversary of Ramkrishana whenwe went there first time. We were very unsure how to reach the Center.But it was a miracle we found some one speaking English at the stationto guide us. This center is quite big area-wise compared to SanFrancisco and Berkeley one that we visited.</description>

But I was not informed aboutthis before. And hotel people informed Pamela and disconnectedtelephone; a real mess. We could not connect each other and convey whatwas happening at two ends.

Reached hotel without problem, had a Chinese femaledriver speaking English. Exhausted and tired to reach work which lookedlike a 5 minutes walk from hotel on map. But, got lost in concretejungle of La Defense which is one of the unique place withconcentrated modern high-rise buildings in Europe.</description>

But when you have friends half way accross theglobe, internet is your best friend.The pictures in these albums aretaken by three different cameras. The first camera I had a Pentax. Now Ihave a Nikon N-80 and recently bought a Digital camera from Olympus.</description>
