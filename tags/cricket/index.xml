You do not need to be a
cricket fan to follow this news as it is every where. I am literally out
raged with this news can you think suddenly British (Barclay)
premiership moves to Spain as cold winter stormed as swapped across
Britain. Mr.Lalit Modi is a big favorite be it media or those franchisee

disappointing. But that does not change Indians breathing cricket - be
at India or abroad.</description></item></channel></rss>
