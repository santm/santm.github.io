      <description>After being guest of GK Homestay for 2 nights at 7.00 we hit the roadtowards Malampuzha. It is about 8 km from the Palakkad town; Palkad isknown as gateway between Tamilnadu and Kerala as it is a valley betweenhills. It is major rice growing area and home of many Tamil Brahmins whoare living in Kerala for centuries.
Malampuzha Garden is build next to reservoir on river with same name.</description>
