and enjoying the butter and sugar lately. Feeling guilty as cann&amp;rsquo;t
resist and moreover did not do any exercise after my Paris - Versailles
marathon :(
We were invited to one of my colleague’s place for the first time after
almost 3 years in France for ‘Galette des rois’. It was very
memorable and an enjoyable evening.</description></item></channel></rss>
