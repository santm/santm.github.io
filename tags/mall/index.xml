These pictures of Aarush are
months apart. One on left with motorcycle are just after his tonsuring
and on the right are just weeks old. He really likes to ride like any
other boy. And if we try to stop him it does not go well at public
place. When we were in Star Bazaar @ Kormangala few weeks back he
remembered where this toy car was kept and every time we tried to
refrain him he used to go back there.</description></item><item><title>Sleepy Monday</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2010-02-23-sleepy-monday/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2010 11:52:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2010-02-23-sleepy-monday/</guid><description>Monday morning mother-son woke up pretty late. Santanu already left for
office while we were in sleep. Around noon we went out of hotel to
nearby mall. Today I was not much interested in exploring rather looking
for kids activities. Spent almost half day at Toys R Us play area in
Paragon mall where Aarush enjoyed to fullest. He did not want to
give-up the car and was seating there for hours.</description></item></channel></rss>
