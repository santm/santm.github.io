      <description>After finishingBelur-Halebidby 3.00PM we moved towards Chikmaglur as we wanted to reach ourApna-Sapna homestaybefore dusk. For God knows what reason here all homestay are highlypriced based on per person per night. The Mountain section fromChikmaglur to Attigundi (village) was excellent and fun to drive on thetwist and turn. The last part was a dirt road where we took diversionfor our homestay a downhill road.</description>
