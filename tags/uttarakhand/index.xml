weather looked gloomy with an overcast sky as we woke up. We had
breakfast at the hotel and decided to visit Rishikesh today. Again we
headed back the way we came yesterday and after crossing Rajaji National
Park the road divides and one goes towards to Dehradun and one to
Rishikesh. The drive was pleasant, as we opted Laxman Jhula as our
destination google map smartly took us via highway bypassing the main
city.</description></item><item><title>Day - 2 Dehradun &amp; Haridwar</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2017-09-13-day-2-dehradun-haridwar/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2017 15:24:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2017-09-13-day-2-dehradun-haridwar/</guid><description>We
work up fresh after a good sleep. But soon we realized we are in a place
which we are very not fond off. May be the Mussoorie did not blink with
us. After taking shower and getting ready for the day we went up to the
restaurant for breakfast. But looked like we were an early riser as
there were no one else and the place was not cleaned up for the day.</description></item><item><title>Day 1 - Drive to Mussoorie</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2017-06-20-day-1-drive-to-mussoorie/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jun 2017 12:39:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2017-06-20-day-1-drive-to-mussoorie/</guid><description>It
was a crazyweek,
as usual, it always happens that the week is very bad forwork, commute and
others just before we go onvacation and come back. So somehow we finished our packing on Thursday
night and set our alarms for early Friday.We
woke up on time and got ready and then call for Uber, the app shows the
taxi is just next to our apartment where normally few Uber/Ola always
are found.</description></item><item><title>Uttarakhand - prelude</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2017-05-31-uttarakhand-prelude/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2017 13:53:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2017-05-31-uttarakhand-prelude/</guid><description>*It
has been such a long time that we posted something we almost forgot how
to type long paragraphs. Maybe all due to Facebook and WhatsApp which is
instant but then in when you look back you have no way to figure out
what all the noise was about. Well enough of rant now let me
type….*Beginning
of 2017 we were very much looking for a vacation and Pamela was
interested in Uttarakhand.</description></item></channel></rss>
