      <description>While categorizing our old travelogs I found there was no post onBelgiumwhich values a lot for me. As I go down the memory lane&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;year 2003,within 2 Â½ months of marriage we have to move to Paris from US which wasa big change for me. Apart from the cultural shock, language was immensebarrier for day today life as well to mingle up with people around. Notonly that, in Indian arrange marriage, it takes time to understand eachother with each one&amp;rsquo;s weaknesses and failings.</description>
