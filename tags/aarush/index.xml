Reptile in general, sniper in nature
eats victims for dinner.
Hunted by poachers
but valued by farmers.
For eliminating pesky pestering pests
weapon of choice is its own tongue;
Must have marksman ship for degree.
Could you guess the animal?
Not a monster,
It is a hidden chameleon.</description></item><item><title>Falcon</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2020-04-01-falcon-by-aarush/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 11:34:56 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2020-04-01-falcon-by-aarush/</guid><description>2020 February 22nd @ Bangalore Claws sharp &amp;amp; eyes wide
looking for target present on site.
You may think this to be a sniper
but its your neighborhood falcon.
This good boy is quite under appreciated
killing soldiers of nether word.
Who destroy grain and plunder world into disease
RATS, soldiers of satan
meet their end with this formidable warrior
But is he a hero to mankind
while his species face extinction.</description></item><item><title>Bats</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2020-04-01-bats-by-aarush/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 11:34:45 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2020-04-01-bats-by-aarush/</guid><description>2020 February 15th @ Calcutta Not your cricket bat nor your baseball bat
but just your friendly animal bat.
Better known as the carrier of disease &amp;amp; death
but is he the black savior of the human kind.
Think again what it can do friend.
Ravages real vampires to the end
mosquitoes everyone till they are in grave.
Killing pestering pests &amp;amp; insects.
Saves 3.5 billion dollars because it does the same thing as the pesticide.</description></item><item><title>A Weekend - supposed to be perfect</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2014-03-18-a-weekend-supposed-to-be-perfect/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2014 15:13:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2014-03-18-a-weekend-supposed-to-be-perfect/</guid><description>Aarush reminded me it&amp;rsquo;s Friday, at breakfast table and that he should

it is Friday very well for his age. Well the weekend was supposed to be
a just another weekend on the calendar with no specific plan. There were
some weekend work/changes/releases at office but not a major ones.
Nowadays my running group is doing long runs on Saturday instead of

changed the course of my life as father. Well I am quite positive on
this sudden turn of event that this happened for good. Pamela suddenly

And they asked her to join immediately. The first week was in training

own apartment. Being new to complex we hardly knew anyone to invite.So
decided to celebrate his B&amp;rsquo;day at school which he of-course didn&amp;rsquo;t like
much as he didn&amp;rsquo;t receive any gifts and top of it he has to give return
gifts to his school mates….which he did so with heavy heart.
We decided to take him to Dubare elephant
camp.</description></item><item><title>Circle and Cycle</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2010-07-02-circle-and-cycle/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2010 17:26:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2010-07-02-circle-and-cycle/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Another weekend</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2010-06-28-another-weekend/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2010 22:16:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2010-06-28-another-weekend/</guid><description>The past weekend was very low key just wanted to laze around to be
honest. It was great to watch to few late nights World Cup Football
matches live with Jishu. Saturday went to usual vegetable market at HAL.
After a quick and early lunch we went to southern part of Bangalore to
drop Jishu back home. It started to drizzle at first and very soon it
was pouring by the time we reached BTM layout.</description></item><item><title>Weekend</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2010-06-24-weekend/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jun 2010 18:22:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2010-06-24-weekend/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Aarush's-Free ride</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2010-05-11-aarushs-free-ride/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2010 22:13:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2010-05-11-aarushs-free-ride/</guid><description>Well another small post with pictures. These pictures of Aarush are
months apart. One on left with motorcycle are just after his tonsuring
and on the right are just weeks old. He really likes to ride like any
other boy. And if we try to stop him it does not go well at public
place. When we were in Star Bazaar @ Kormangala few weeks back he
remembered where this toy car was kept and every time we tried to
refrain him he used to go back there.</description></item><item><title>Aarush turns 2</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2010-01-16-aarush-turns-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2010 22:24:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2010-01-16-aarush-turns-2/</guid><description>Aarush tuned 2.

Being uncertain about travel plans ahead we got his passport ready in
hurry-burry where my darling posed in front of camera without much
hesitation.
He can balance to sit unsupported but for short time while leaning
forward and spreading his legs out wide and straight for support. He
started to recognize people. On calling his name from back he use to
turn around to find where sounds come from.</description></item><item><title>Playing football</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2009-07-04-playing-football/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul 2009 06:20:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2009-07-04-playing-football/</guid><description>Aarush having nice time in green patch of IIM Bangalore Campus. Color of
ball and his T-shirt coincidently matched and isn&amp;rsquo;t that look nice on
green background? I took Pamela and Aarush to show them the southern
part of Bangalore which I am visiting quite often this year on academic
purpose. A great place to escape from routine life and bring back
memories of &amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;Purani Jeans Aur Guitar&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; days.</description></item><item><title>Aarush @ Swimming pool</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2009-06-24-aarush-swimming-pool/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jun 2009 05:58:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2009-06-24-aarush-swimming-pool/</guid><description>During April and May Aarush and Pamela went to Swimming pool almost
daily for a few weeks. Every day around 10:30 or so he would make his
best effort to get his swimming gear and would ask us to put it for him.
But after few weeks we had to stop as we realized his cough was not
getting cured and he got lots of sun tan. And now after the operation he
is out of scope for any water sports for next one year.</description></item><item><title>Sixth month</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2009-06-17-sixth-month/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2009 00:01:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2009-06-17-sixth-month/</guid><description>(17thJune - 16thJuly)
After rice ceremony at Siliguri we finally came to Bangalore. This time
he was fine both in train and plane. We stayed in service apartment for
3 nights till our things moved to our rented apartment.
Too many changes of weather, locations and little less care Aarush got
high fever for the first time and we had to rush him to Manipal. When it
settled we started to strolled within our apartment complex to know our
neighborhood more.</description></item><item><title>Visit to OT</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2009-05-30-visit-to-ot/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 May 2009 05:15:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2009-05-30-visit-to-ot/</guid><description>Aarush was having cough for long time almost few months from now. Every
now and then it used to increase and then it subsided with cough syrup.
Every time we thought after a week of cough syrup treatment it will be
better but it somehow never got cured completely. In between, we tried
different &amp;ldquo;pathys&amp;rdquo; as suggested by experienced parents. Now last month
while he was getting immunization after 15th months doctor suggested to
visit ENT specialist because of prolonged cough and speech delay.</description></item><item><title>Fifth Month</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2009-05-15-fifth-month/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2009 05:12:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2009-05-15-fifth-month/</guid><description>May 17- June 16
By 5th month slowly started introducing solid food like banana and
apple puree to Aarush. According to our custom till
&amp;ldquo;Annaprasanna&amp;rdquo;
we are not suppose to introduce solid food like rice or wheat to baby.
And his didu was also against using common baby food item like &amp;ldquo;Cerelac&amp;rdquo;
as they contain rice or wheat. This resulted in his first solid bite
being fruit &amp;ndash; mashed banana. The first spoon he swallowed as my mom
fed him, but little man has a frown of disapproval, like &amp;ldquo;what the heck
they are feeding me?</description></item><item><title>playing with bubbles</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2009-04-28-playing-with-bubbles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2009 04:42:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2009-04-28-playing-with-bubbles/</guid><description>Aarush and Pamela playing with soap bubbles ; this video is bit old when

Normally A is taken to doctor for monthly check-up once other then that
no outing for him. As he is considered too small for all these by my
parents. So they neither allow him nor me to go anywhere. After birth it
was third time when Aarush was taken out of the house to meet people
other then his doc&amp;rsquo;s clinic. Moreover because of weather it was
difficult for us to go anywhere.</description></item><item><title>Third month</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2009-04-15-third-month/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2009 11:39:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2009-04-15-third-month/</guid><description>(17th March-16th April)
Now, Aarush started to twitch, smile, frown and stretch a lot after
waking from sleep. Amazingly ( I never knew this) and apparently babies
between three to four months are at the stage where they get very
playful and drinking milk is not a priority anymore, I believe. They
prefer to talk and coo to adults, and being very observant at this stage
and they are attracted to moving objects, colours and everything new
around them.</description></item><item><title>Second month</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2009-04-04-second-month/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Apr 2009 01:49:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2009-04-04-second-month/</guid><description>(17th February- 17th March)
Parenthood is a lifelong journey. No amount of training and
preparation can ever prepare fully for it. We are learning about our
little helpless bundle and same probably on his side. After returning
from official trip santanu was agog to spent more time with Aarush as if
it was ages he has spent not seeing him.
Aarush now learnt to squeal in delight as his arms flail about in the
air above him.</description></item><item><title>Playing trumpet</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2009-04-03-playing-trumpet/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Apr 2009 23:30:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2009-04-03-playing-trumpet/</guid><description>Aarush playing trumpet, he was around 11 months old that time and did

This is a unedited video of
16 minutes long, I have no knowledge on video editing. The video was
captured by Jishu-Dadu of

let us know your feedback. Going to publish few more videos of Aarush
soon.</description></item><item><title>First month</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2009-03-07-first-month/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Mar 2009 14:28:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2009-03-07-first-month/</guid><description>Tiredness was still there after delivery and by now I realized what
people were talking about… shamelessly take advantage of this period to
rest yourself. On other hand I was desperate to take a step outside
house of my own after 9 months bed rest to feel the breeze brushing
against my skin. But it never happened because of customs.
Ooof&amp;hellip;. On 10th day took a complete shower from head to toe as on
same day my stitch was removed which took hardly few minutes.</description></item><item><title>Birth of a Mother-II</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2009-02-25-birth-of-a-mother-ii/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2009 05:42:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2009-02-25-birth-of-a-mother-ii/</guid><description>Truly said-

As soon as I was moved out of O.T. Aarush was brought to his crib next
to me. His didu was first to hold him in her arms then was given
forcefully to his thamma. She didn&amp;rsquo;t wanted to take him as it seems he
would become &amp;ldquo;Kol-lengra&amp;rdquo; (will get use to be in arms).</description></item><item><title>Birth of a Mother-I</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2009-02-22-birth-of-a-mother-i/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2009 03:50:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2009-02-22-birth-of-a-mother-i/</guid><description>It was 11th Jan when I went to my gynecologist in emergency as
couldn&amp;rsquo;t feel the movements. After check-up she mentioned that if my
baby didn&amp;rsquo;t arrive anytime sooner than 15 she would have to perform an
induction. She didn&amp;rsquo;t wanted to take any risk at this stage because of
cervical incompetence and heart problem. So at last, we opted for
planned c-section on 17th Jan.
Night before took admission at MGM Belapur, Navi Mumbai.</description></item><item><title>Feeling the Kicks</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2009-02-19-feeling-the-kicks/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2009 04:48:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2009-02-19-feeling-the-kicks/</guid><description>Friends and near ones use to ask me quite often then - Do you feel the
movement?
No (use to be my reply).
Somewhere, I use to wonder how it feels like the movement of the baby
inside. It was tough to answer as first timer. On routine check -up my
doctor asked the same whether I feel the movement and I nodded in
negative. Immediately asked her how it actually feels.</description></item><item><title>Journey to Motherhood</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2009-02-04-journey-to-motherhood/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2009 15:12:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2009-02-04-journey-to-motherhood/</guid><description>Remembering my journey to motherhood as Aarush turns one year old. After
4 years of marriage and lot of traveling around Europe Santanu decided
to move back to India to find a better professional career. Life as
couple was not full of hip and happening but we were happy and carefree
about the same. I use to scorn at people whenever brought up kids in
topic; balked at elders. After getting back to India this pressure was
getting on me.</description></item><item><title>Joyeux Anniversaire- mon petit</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2009-02-03-joyeux-anniversaire-mon-petit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2009 04:21:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2009-02-03-joyeux-anniversaire-mon-petit/</guid><description>As usual there is lots of gaps of posting. Last month was quite hectic
as we celebrated Aarush&amp;rsquo;s first birthday
We started planning from December onwards. As our schedule now revolves
around his nap-time and whims we hardly get time for each other or to
discuss any matter it’s just a lot more rare these days than it used to
be. So, gone are the days of last minute plan. Despite how he has
completely turned our lives upside down we wanted to celebrate his first
b&amp;rsquo;day which I know he hardly will acknowledge at this age.</description></item><item><title>Peekaboo</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2008-12-11-peekaboo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2008 05:07:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2008-12-11-peekaboo/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Extempo Performance</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2008-08-28-extempo-performance/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2008 04:40:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2008-08-28-extempo-performance/</guid><description>Pamela&amp;rsquo;s maternal cousin

Today you are four months old&amp;hellip;though nothing remarkable but for me it
has been days now since we met last. Hope you to be fit as fiddle.
I came to know from your mom that now your vision is focused more or
less, you are trying to grasp objects; can bat and swipe at dangling
toys. It seems now you are ready to rock and roll as you have started
taking side turns with squirms, giggles and wails&amp;hellip; You respond to your
nani (granny) and aunt with big toothless smiles as well with coos and
making happy noises.</description></item><item><title>My Best Picture</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2008-03-04-my-best-picture/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2008 02:51:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2008-03-04-my-best-picture/</guid><description>Aarush has crossed 6 weeks mark now and till recent time there was no
picture of him with me. Well, there was no specific reason for the same.
Normally, when I leave for work he is sleeping and in the evening it is
dark and we are against using flash while taking pictures of Aarush.
That leave only weekend but recent weekends were very hectic and I was

cables needed for announcing the arrival of Aarush. Few starring eyes
caught me in action when I did fired-up SMS from my laptop. There was no

Though this breaking news
was shared on d-day instantly with friends and families from Hospital
via SMS and emails. I specifically carried my camera, laptop and
wireless data card for the same.
I created two announcement cards one in pink and other in blue with two
names (for girl and boy) and kept them ready. We never disclosed this
big-news in last few months in our blog in-fact it was kept secret to
many except close family members and few friends.</description></item></channel></rss>
