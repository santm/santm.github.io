      <description>Can any one guess what this publicity is about? Well, this is 2006 antiAids campaign by city hall of Paris (Paris prot√®ge l&amp;rsquo;amour meansParis protects love)
In the photo what we see is sunset on some historical building with moonat backdrop, but when you take a close look moon is&amp;hellip; a condom. It aimsat promoting the use of condoms among the population i.e., to have safesex.</description>

      <description>This is about my commute to work nowadays when weather is graceful withme and I ride to work. I hope it can not be better than this. Crossingthe most green part (there are loooooots of green bucks around aswell) of PARIS on a bike.
I leave you to explore the rest from Google map. I am sure you will havefun. If I compare this with people in Bay-Area (CA), New-York orBangalore, Delhi I think people will envy me.</description>
