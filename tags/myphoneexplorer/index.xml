      <description>As I said before I went to hospital on d-day with my Laptop and allcables needed for announcing the arrival of Aarush. Few starring eyescaught me in action when I did fired-up SMS from my laptop. There was noway I could have managed sending all SMS(es) by phone only. So, I had tosend SMS in batches : one to my professional contacts, other to extendedfamily and rest to Pamela&amp;rsquo;s contact list.</description>

      <description>Well I gotit. Afterlots of deliberation I upgraded my choice to K790 from K750. The bigdifference is price and features to say in simple words. I heard inrecent time James Bond used this same phone in his lastmovie. Not sure what all otheraccessories Mr.Qadded for him on the film.
I wanted to buy a camera phone as that will be handy to capture events.</description>
