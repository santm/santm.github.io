      <description>As you know the growth of mobile is one of BIG discussion point of anytechnology seminar or talk show you attend today. Everybody alreadypredicting more and more people will use mobile to accessinternet/information/e-commerce compared to traditional desktop orlaptop. And in a country like India there will be lots of users who willbe &amp;ldquo;on-line&amp;rdquo; for the first time and they will directly use a smartphone bypassing key-board and mice altogether, in numbers they might belarger than some European country.</description>

      <description>Installed all these three on pamela.santm.com and blog.santm.com whichare running on wordpress 3.6 trunk. moved the dns details to cloudflare.While Pamela&amp;rsquo;s hobby site did very well Google page test result our blogresult was not great. Looks like the culprit is inbuilt gallery ofwordpress which is re-sizing images and seving them on fly causing highserver time. the command that helped me a lot is &amp;ldquo;mogrify -strip *.</description>

So I went with the current one and didnot did not did much changes.</description>

      <description>Gallery 3 isgoing to a big change from current gallery 2 and initial alpha releasedid not have any migration path from gallery2. It was pushed to Betarelease after 2 alpha releases. but to my surprise I found it wasimplemented in alpha 4 and here is the test result of a new neat code. Iam really liking the new compact code making gallery 3 faster and leancompared to its predecessor.</description>

      <description>Our old faithful I-pod’sbattery died last year; nothing to complain about the same. We have usedit enough and did not have any complain. Only thing that happened is thebattery started to loose charge more often and at the end it stoppedcharging altogether. Just after I got this I-Pod, Apple had to settle alawsuit for lowquality batteries. That way I must say I am happy to survive for 3 yearswith one battery.</description>

      <description>Well downloaded G-Phone application fromGoogle. on my Blackberry. All I needed wasdata access enabled phone to download G-phone. The speculation wasrunning high about a new hardware from Google in lots of web sites. Letssee how these applications (Gmail, Google maps, Google news, Googlesearch, Gtalk, Google calender) will work on a normal phone where thedisplay is not as big as Blackberry and you do not have full keyboard ortrack wheel.</description>

      <description>Trying to jazz up skittlish theme ofwordpresswith silk icon sets fromfamfamfam.com.In recent time there is new version of skittlish supporting widgets so Ithought it might be a god starting ground. Best part - for few colors(red, orange, green &amp;amp; blue) there are icons available for tag, user(author). But for rest there is none. As I am not a graphic person notsure how should I go forward.</description>

      <description>Micro$oft is doing a round of business and technical launch show aroundIndia. The products are Exchange 2007, Office 2007 and Vista. I attendedonly a brief session @ Hyatt.
Well, somehow my name was not there even though I registered 10 daysbefore the event.
And my business card with orange and blue dots did not help much to getattention from those desk people. Anyway, it was solid 40 minutes ofwork for me – replied emails, chat with business contact got updatesfrom their team – thanks to CDMA mobile card.</description>

P.S. I got the pro account :D</description>

      <description>Well another day! Some techie note ; upgraded the web site to the latestbeta release of Wordpress. And I found some strange behaviour. This iswhat I put forward to the mailing list. But with few minute of researchfound the root cause.
WP is adding [code]
[/code] as extra inside in my [code]
[/code]This was one example.[code]
[/code]
It was happening due to &amp;ldquo;wp-include/formatting.php&amp;rdquo;. I use plaintext mode while doing copy-paste between text-editor from my PC toWordpress Editor.</description>

      <description>I just wanted to share my home network. It is not a state oftechnologies with the latest &amp;amp; greatest wireless or wired network withcomplex router and switches. I did it in old school way with a singlelong CAT5 Ethernet Cable. I have a FreeBox which is an ADSL2 routerconnecting to the main phone jack. The output from theFreeBox connects my PC, Television andPhone. Now all these components are connected with the single wire asI mentioned before.</description>

      <description>Folding @ Home is a Stanford University project of understating proteinfolding. It is distributed computing where small tasks are sent toPersonal Computers (PC) across the world and it uses those CPU power tocalculate. The results are sent back to the main computer. It is a verysafe program and probably you will not notice any performance change foryour computer.
There are similar projects for understanding Genome to AIDS which usesmore or less similar technology of distributed computing.</description>

      <description>This script you run on the source host from the same directory where allthose rrd files are there. I found this very helpful while migratingbetween Linux and Solaris.
#/bin/cshset all_files=`echo *.rrd`echo $all_filesforeach file ( $all_files )set base = `basename $file .rrd`/bin/rrdtool dump $file &amp;gt; /tmp/new1/$base.xmlend The do a `tar` with `gzip` as that will save lots of space and timewhile transferring data between machines.</description>

      <description>After months of checking web sites for prices reading forums for reviewand always thinking about moving out Paris I got my new PC. It was notan easy choice as all these years I wanted a Mac from Apple. AndMini-Mac was a real contender for long time.
But at the end I went for mini-PC because of the money and choice offlexibility I have with the same.</description>
