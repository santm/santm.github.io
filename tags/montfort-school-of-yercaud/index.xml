      <description>Thefirst-daywegot little suspicious with the transport rates being quoted by KanchanView Hotel Manager. We reportedthat back to Calcutta the tour operator Mr. D. Ghosh.

TheHotel person by now have charged us 2500 for the first day covering onlyTagore Smritivan , monastery and forest bungalow. For the second day wepaid 2500 to cover 5/6 places but the distance was more.</description>
