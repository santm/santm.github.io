      <description>In 2013 we had very little family vacation time. I personally travelledhere and there for single nights few times due to running and otherpersonal work. The worst was to spend a week in Calcutta just afterDurga Pooja and not able to accomplish anything there. So when Decembervacation time was only few days away I booked for Goa for 4 nightswithout much thinking. Personally felt quite happy with the booking asgot a decent price for Goa just before X-mas.</description>
