our family trips for birding. These pictures were taken around Virajpet
(South Coorg) and few within Nagarhole National Park. from our recent
trip in 2108 October.
The birds found here are very common to birds of Kerala as they are very
close by.</description></item><item><title>Birds of Kerala</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2018-10-16-birds-of-kerala/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 16:03:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2018-10-16-birds-of-kerala/</guid><description>Some birds spotted in Kerala around Thekkady and Thattekad.</description></item><item><title>Kerala 2018 Thekkady and Thattekad</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2018-10-16-kerala-2018-thekkady-and-thattekad/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 14:56:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2018-10-16-kerala-2018-thekkady-and-thattekad/</guid><description>Just back from a week-long trip of Kerala. We left on a Monday quite
unusualÂ day to start a trip, always there is something new to do. We
left home at 4:10 AM and b&amp;rsquo;cos of that we had almost zero traffic in
crossing Bangalore city and every toll both we did had any queue and by
7:30 we reached Salem and stopped for Breakfast. Post breakfast we had
to cross Salem and by 12ish we are in the border of Tamil Nadu &amp;amp; Kerala.</description></item></channel></rss>
