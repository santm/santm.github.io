went in 2000 with my parents. Rajasthan roads are amazing; and they are
very well connected interms of bus, train, private cars, even one can
hire cars to drive around between different places with in state. This
makes travelling in Rajasthan quite safe and less tiring. With good road
conditions you can also explore the interiors of Rajasthan.</description></item></channel></rss>
