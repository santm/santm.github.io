sleeping I was thinking about the same again and again. Wished for a
gadget to record my thought as I was too tired to use any keyboard or
voice recorder. At times we wonder and sometime make fun of those award
ceremonies where people on the stage keep on thanking people around him
or her and sometimes even their dogs.</description></item><item><title>Pipeline Road Run</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2013-08-04-pipeline-road-run/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Aug 2013 23:41:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2013-08-04-pipeline-road-run/</guid><description>There was a discussion in the running group to practice hill-run before
upcoming Hyderabad run which I am trying to be a regular member.
Normally the &amp;ldquo;numero uno&amp;rdquo; destination for hill training around Bangalore
is Nandi Hill ; which is 60KM north of the city. Have already run Nandi
hills few times and yes Nandi is grueling specially the last 3 KM. Nandi
run is 15KM in total where you go 7.</description></item></channel></rss>
