      <description>After a full day @ Santosa on Sunday we woke up pretty late. We decidedto go for Jurong bird park and offbeat track -Kong Meng San PhorKark See Monastery, is the largest monastery in Singapore.
We had breakfast at ChatterBox as the normal breakfast side was packed.The menu was quite different from the normal side as we had lots oftraditional dishes to choose from. As usual Pamela had lots of dim-sumand I preferred the usual cereal and fruits.</description>
