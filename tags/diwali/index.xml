reading. I am not a writer nor pose to have any writing skill but I like
to read. It is said the type of books you read generally depends on your
attitude and personality. I believe reading as a habit has always
allowed to nurture a wholesome sense of well being. But most of us read
books to lull ourselves to sleep.</description></item><item><title>Festival of lights</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2007-11-09-festival-of-lights/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Nov 2007 18:50:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2007-11-09-festival-of-lights/</guid><description>Today as we celebrate Indiaâ€™s grand festival of Light signaling triumph
over evil after a protracted fight which is marked by lighting of oil
based traditional earthen or clay lamps as they shine brightly in each
and every home - Be it lowly or mightily from the hut of the poor to the
mansion of the rich when good with all its might, leads us from darkness
to light. A day when old and young indulge in royal feast on this
festival of snacks and sweet.</description></item><item><title>Happy Holidays</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2005-12-28-happy-holidays/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2005 21:57:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2005-12-28-happy-holidays/</guid><description>**Wish you all happy &amp;amp; prosperous New Year.**Its time to write almost
last entry for this year.
For quite a while was thinking to write about 2005 year diary.
Hmm&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;not able to write with this dull and grey sky and no need
to mention the cold at Paris but wait&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip; seems some ray of
light is trying to reach my desk which I do not want to loose, hope that
will keep my spirit high while writing this.</description></item><item><title>Diwali at Paris</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2005-11-10-diwali-at-paris/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2005 10:43:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2005-11-10-diwali-at-paris/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Are you safe out there?&amp;rdquo; This was typical question to which I have been
answering to my friends and relatives after the riots at Paris suburbs.
I myself was keeping updated with news only. &amp;ldquo;Thank God&amp;rdquo; it looks like
getting better now. I would not like to make any comments and express my
view on the same as it seems to be very complex matter.
We celebrated Diwali quite well this year.</description></item><item><title>Paper Anniversary</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2003-11-08-paper-anniversary/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2003 06:29:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2003-11-08-paper-anniversary/</guid><description>Yes!!!
