      <description>The first thing that struck me about Rajasthan was its roads when I lastwent in 2000 with my parents. Rajasthan roads are amazing; and they arevery well connected interms of bus, train, private cars, even one canhire cars to drive around between different places with in state. Thismakes travelling in Rajasthan quite safe and less tiring. With good roadconditions you can also explore the interiors of Rajasthan.</description>
