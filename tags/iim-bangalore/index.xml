      <description>Officially it is overâ€¦ ten month long journey came to an end. There weretwo exams and one submission before pulling the final curtain byNovember end.
Before writing further I must thank Pamela for persuading me inenrolling in to this Executive MBA (EXMP) of IIM Bangalore.
The course in nutshell covers almost all the areas of management andgives you enough foundation to build your own interest in specific area.</description>
