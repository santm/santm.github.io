and he wanted an excuse from strenuous week at IIM-B and we ended up
planning to visit Shravanabelagola right after Diwali day. Unlike
his earlier trip he just had a casual look at the route map to
Shravanabelagola, it is a religious spot, a Jain pilgrimage centre.
The place is famous for 58ft. high monolithic stone statue of the Lord
Gommateshwara.</description></item></channel></rss>
