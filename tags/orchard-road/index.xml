      <description>A four letter word of our modern consumerism; like all other 4 letterswords this is very commonly used.
The first time I was introduced to this was back in USA on Labor Dayweekend (1st week of September-’98). In US, every long weekendbrings a SALE. Size of weekend supplement of news-paper increaseswith advertisement from cars to toys. Not only that even you getconstant reminder from Macy’s to Wal-mart on your radio while you driveyour car.</description>
