there was a sudden storm, followed by rain and finally power cut off. We
got up around 6 AM and moved out of the place before 7 AM so as to avoid
school traffic. We headed towards Elephant caves which come on the way
to Cherrapunji, before that we saw the sign for Shillong Peak. And the
sun was perfect to see the entire Shillong from the peak but as we
approached near the turning and asked one passer-by whether it will be
open.</description></item><item><title>Day 2 - Shillong</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2018-05-21-day-2-shillong/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 May 2018 11:29:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2018-05-21-day-2-shillong/</guid><description>We started early morning with a drive to pick-up point of our rented
car. This place was in such an area where proper roads were not
thereâ€¦.it was full of potholes and filled with rainwater from previous
rains. One thing is there Guwahati inner roads are not great and even
city is not that clean&amp;hellip;full of plastics. Anyways we zoomed out from
that place without much wastage of time and hit the highway.</description></item></channel></rss>
