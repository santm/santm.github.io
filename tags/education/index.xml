      <description>Well my French classes came to an end. And I passed the exam :D I wouldlike to take up the Oscar podium for few seconds and like to thank mybeloved wife Pamela for her support ; my teacher, my colleagues- Stephanand Fred for their time and effort to make me understand the basics ofFrench grammar. And I am very satisfied that I didn&amp;rsquo;t let them down as Iscored well in grammar and got all the Pass√©-compose andImparfait (past tense) correct.</description>
