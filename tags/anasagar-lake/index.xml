This time our
cab driver from hotel (Madhuban) was waiting and on reaching hotel
relaxed for while. Before leaving for Jodhpur, we have fixed
with Mr. Singh (our reliable cab driver) for this trip to
Ajmer-Pushkar. As usual, he was there on time; left hotel room
around 8.00am. Had our breakfast on way at small neat and clean dhaba.
Road being 6 lane; had very comfort drive and was hardly crowded.</description></item></channel></rss>
