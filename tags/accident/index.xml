      <description>Woke up at 4:25 AM ; it was supposed it be a a long day for me as I tryto run 39 KM practice run in a easy pace. Though I am not going toparticipate in the upcoming SCMM (Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon)2015 I decided to stick with the full marathoner group to see howgrueling their preparation can be.Â Assembled at 4:45 in front of the NCBS gate and met an ultra marathonerfrom our running group who already covered 23KM starting from 02:30 AM.</description>
