      <description>Kaziranga is one of the bigger National Park of India. It has threeprominent zones - Central, Western and Eastern.
Central Range &amp;ndash; This drive covers the central region of the park.It is an ideal introduction to the park and its ecology as the routepasses through the entire spectrum of habitat types prevalent in theKaziranga area. (though Brahmaputra view is not available, a stretch ofthe route goes by the tributary river Difloo) There is a possibility ofsighting elephants as well as the other big animals especially the swampbuffalo and of course the rhino.</description>

For today I havealready decided to go to Botanical garden in first half of the day.So took a cab from hotel and I figured it was very nearby. Thisbotanical garden is must if you want to see the greenery and variety ofplants and flowers they have. Excellent maintenance, people come herefor jogging, picnic and touristy purpose.</description>
