long day we were very tired . The train was late as it arrived from
Delhi. On the train meet Subhojit who was also in Rajasthan for one
long week break just like us from Bangalore. Their itinerary was bit
different compared to us and they were going to Jaiselmer. On the wee
hours of 1st November reached the platform of Jodhpur and thankgod for
