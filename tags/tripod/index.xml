      <description>Love taking pictures with long shutter speed at night - technique isvery simple. All I needed was a tripod to secure camera from shakingwhile leaving the camera shutter open. I know this is not a greatpicture but that is what I got from my balcony. A better one withKharghar landmark Utsav Chowk is postedhere.</description>
