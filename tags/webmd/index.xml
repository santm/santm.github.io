Every
now and then it used to increase and then it subsided with cough syrup.
Every time we thought after a week of cough syrup treatment it will be
better but it somehow never got cured completely. In between, we tried
different &amp;ldquo;pathys&amp;rdquo; as suggested by experienced parents. Now last month
while he was getting immunization after 15th months doctor suggested to
visit ENT specialist because of prolonged cough and speech delay.</description></item></channel></rss>
