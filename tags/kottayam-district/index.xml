Moreover, my son got fractured elbow but then also our spirit was on
high although bit dampened that whether we will enjoy or not; kind of
excitement mixed with anxiety, hope and happiness. I still remember the
moment we sat in the car and started for the trip which was going to be
one of the longest drive with Aarush.</description></item><item><title>Backwater:Kumarakom</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2012-08-17-backwater-kumarakom/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Aug 2012 14:46:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2012-08-17-backwater-kumarakom/</guid><description>Around 10 we started for our next destination to Kottayam which was
around 140K M away. From Varkala we started following the road signs for
Kochi but once we almost approached Kottayam/ Kumarakom we got little
bit lost but soon found our way towards Kottayam. Roads were good except
last part near GK Riverview home
stay
(Rough Guide recommendation). The owner of the homestay tried his best
to discourage from coming with a small kid which infact made us more
determined to stay with him.</description></item></channel></rss>
