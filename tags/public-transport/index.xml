for 10 days. We started our trip with flight from Paris to Madrid on
Saturday 21st May 2005.
We reached Charles de Gaulle Airport on time and the checking was smooth
but after boarding the plane we were in ground for almost one hour
before taking off. The cost cutting measures with European state
carriers are all alike now, so there is no free snacks &amp;amp; drinks in the
short flight.</description></item></channel></rss>
