For today I have
already decided to go to Botanical garden in first half of the day.
So took a cab from hotel and I figured it was very nearby. This
botanical garden is must if you want to see the greenery and variety of
plants and flowers they have. Excellent maintenance, people come here
for jogging, picnic and touristy purpose.</description></item></channel></rss>
