looking for target present on site.
You may think this to be a sniper
but its your neighborhood falcon.
This good boy is quite under appreciated
killing soldiers of nether word.
Who destroy grain and plunder world into disease
RATS, soldiers of satan
meet their end with this formidable warrior
But is he a hero to mankind
while his species face extinction.</description></item></channel></rss>
