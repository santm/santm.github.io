Shravanabelagola
in 2009. From then on it was always in discussion to visit Belur-Halebid
known for its hoysala architecture. This time we covered both
Belur-Halebid along with Chigmanglur on 3 day trip. We started at
7.10AM from our parking lot and reached Halebid by 12 with two breaks -
breakfast at Hotel Mayura and at Hassan for ATM.</description></item></channel></rss>
