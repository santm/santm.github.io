      <description>We wanted to visit all the top attractions of Italy in one trip but dueto vacation time (for Parisians) and taking off from work and withPamela&amp;rsquo;s school we could not do. So, we planned for only Rome. Weflew with Alitalia from CDG this time in early morning. It was muchbetter than Ryan Airlines in terms of access to the airport. But theinitial fun started when just before checking-in we have to run 3terminals to collect our tickets from Air Traffic office.</description>
