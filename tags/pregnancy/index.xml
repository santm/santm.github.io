As soon as I was moved out of O.T. Aarush was brought to his crib next
to me. His didu was first to hold him in her arms then was given
forcefully to his thamma. She didn&amp;rsquo;t wanted to take him as it seems he
would become &amp;ldquo;Kol-lengra&amp;rdquo; (will get use to be in arms).</description></item><item><title>Birth of a Mother-I</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2009-02-22-birth-of-a-mother-i/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2009 03:50:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2009-02-22-birth-of-a-mother-i/</guid><description>It was 11th Jan when I went to my gynecologist in emergency as
couldn&amp;rsquo;t feel the movements. After check-up she mentioned that if my
baby didn&amp;rsquo;t arrive anytime sooner than 15 she would have to perform an
induction. She didn&amp;rsquo;t wanted to take any risk at this stage because of
cervical incompetence and heart problem. So at last, we opted for
planned c-section on 17th Jan.
Night before took admission at MGM Belapur, Navi Mumbai.</description></item><item><title>Feeling the Kicks</title><link>https://santm.com/blog/2009-02-19-feeling-the-kicks/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2009 04:48:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/blog/2009-02-19-feeling-the-kicks/</guid><description>Friends and near ones use to ask me quite often then - Do you feel the
movement?
No (use to be my reply).
Somewhere, I use to wonder how it feels like the movement of the baby
inside. It was tough to answer as first timer. On routine check -up my
doctor asked the same whether I feel the movement and I nodded in
negative. Immediately asked her how it actually feels.</description></item></channel></rss>
