      <description>After a deep slumber the next morning we woke-up fresh and energetic.Aarush wanted to play seeing an open space- courtyard. They have toys,cycles, carom board, badminton court, balls to play with. He was reallyhappy to get all these stuffs. What more parent wants if kid is happyyou are happy otherwise nothing on earth can make you happy.
Morning, we were shown all rooms available there. It was a nice roomwith a central common area and one room each on either side.</description>
