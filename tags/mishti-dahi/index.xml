      <description>Itâ€™s too hot and humid with power failure I was sweating like a hell.Though just few minutes before I took my shower. Having my last portionof lunch I was searching desperately for something in my fridge butactually I forgot to buy one. My all time favourite item which I caneven take truckload if needed in any form. It is generally considered tocool the body in tropical climates.</description>
