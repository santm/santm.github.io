      <description>It is impossible not to eavesdrop when people are having a loudconversation on phone in Mumbai&amp;rsquo;s life line - local train.
Unlike other days today morning, was special one which is worthdescribing.
A guy gets in; stands next to me and elbows me to make his room andstarts chatting over mobile (so how it goes&amp;hellip;.).
â€œSorry yaar (friend) had to switch off the mobile as train was comingin; you know how much rush is there nowadays.</description>
