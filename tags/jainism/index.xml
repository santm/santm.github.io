to hotel is another headache if you don’t have pick-up service
particularly at wee hours. We didn&amp;rsquo;t had that service from hotel as it
was extra 100INR so on reaching station we found, 10 people surrounded
us even they don’t allow couples to talk among themselves. Finally
hired one for 40 INR to go to Deoki Niwas hotel. When we reached, we
literally had to wake them up.</description></item></channel></rss>
