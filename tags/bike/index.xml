pictures from my
bike route as promised in earlier
post. There is a
movie which I tried to shoot while riding with my digital camera (which
is quite old now). Last weekend was very rainy and stormy so being at
home tried MPG4 and QuickTime. MOV version is around 7 MB but the
quality is so so while QuickTime version of the same is big around 26MB
with better quality.</description></item></channel></rss>
