      <description>The first trip to France countryside was to Cantal -central region for 3days with Murali &amp;amp; Joydeep on July 14th. Cantal, in France&amp;rsquo;s MassifCentral, is the largest volcanic edifice in Europe. We went by car,Murali did a wonderful job by seating at the back of steering wheel &amp;amp;Joydeep at navigatorâ€™s seat while we two were enjoying sleeping (fromtime to time) at back seat. We enjoyed a natural landscape which wasreally worth seeing through own eyes- rolling hills, lush greenfarmlands, small mountains, forests &amp;amp; valleys.</description>
