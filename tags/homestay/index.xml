Belur-Halebid
by 3.00PM we moved towards Chikmaglur as we wanted to reach our
Apna-Sapna homestay
before dusk. For God knows what reason here all homestay are highly
priced based on per person per night. The Mountain section from
Chikmaglur to Attigundi (village) was excellent and fun to drive on the
twist and turn. The last part was a dirt road where we took diversion
for our homestay a downhill road.</description></item><item><title>Visit to North kerala- Wayanad</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2009-04-12-visit-to-north-kerala-wayanad/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Apr 2009 06:04:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2009-04-12-visit-to-north-kerala-wayanad/</guid><description>From the time Santanu having classes and top of it exams this month; its
really a grueling month for both of us. For this I too was not getting
some time off from “Our little one”. There was absolute need of one
break. Santanu suddenly said two days before last exam that he is having
leave and if interested then we can go somewhere near by. Then he only
started reading on net and ended up saying we would go to
WAYANAD- Northern region of Kerala.</description></item></channel></rss>
