When digital camera came out with decent mega pixel was an early adapter
of the same. But soon realized sharing Pictures on email was not an
option and hosted pictures on Tripod. Oh! they used to give 10MB of
free hosting :) now Flicker gives one 1TB free. So long story small
after the managing own gallyery app writen initally with csv and php ,
later mysql and php and lastly Gallery for almost 10 years.</description></item><item><title>Gallerry 3 sneak peak</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2009-05-08-gallerry-3-sneak-peak/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 May 2009 16:03:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2009-05-08-gallerry-3-sneak-peak/</guid><description>Gallery 3 is
going to a big change from current gallery 2 and initial alpha release
did not have any migration path from gallery2. It was pushed to Beta
release after 2 alpha releases. but to my surprise I found it was
implemented in alpha 4 and here is the test result of a new neat code. I
am really liking the new compact code making gallery 3 faster and lean
compared to its predecessor.</description></item></channel></rss>
