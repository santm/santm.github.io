We reached
the outskirt of the city and asked for direction to Emerald/Avalanche
and reached bypassing central Ooty town. We passed Ooty lake on Lake
Road and crossed Good Shepherd School, Fern Hill Road and at last drove
on Avalanche Road. The place ‘Avalanche’ gets its name as there was a
massive land slide in early 1800. From Emerald (after the bridge) we
took a left and the road condition continued to degrade as we crossed
Avalanche Lake.</description></item></channel></rss>
