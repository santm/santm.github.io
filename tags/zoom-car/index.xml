This place was in such an area where proper roads were not thereâ€¦.it was full of potholes and filled with rainwater from previous rains. One thing is there Guwahati inner roads are not great and even city is not that clean&amp;hellip;full of plastics. Anyways we zoomed out from that place without much wastage of time and hit the highway.</description></item></channel></rss>
