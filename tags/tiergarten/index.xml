      <description>Freshened up to kick start our day and decided to go through past ofGermany. Took metro and got off at Potsdamer platz. Had coffee atStarbucks just outside the metro exit as it was too cold.
From here we walked to Checkpoint Charlie - a crossing point betweenEast and West Germany during the Cold War and Berlin Wall Memorial.The scenes blur as present dissolves into the past. Images flash throughour mind of 1989 when news flashed with headlines of demolition ofBerlin wall.</description>
