      <description>Long prologue … someone once said
  ***“Happiness is to plan a trip to somewhere new with your lovedones”. ***
 One best friend from Santanu’s engineering college got transferred fromBangalore to Shillong last year. In his send-off party, everyonecommitted that they would like to visit that part of the country. Thefriend in question is serving our country and he promised to be our hostthere while we visit Shillong, the Scotland of East and British summercapital of North East.</description>

Well enough of rant now let metype….*Beginningof 2017 we were very much looking for a vacation and Pamela wasinterested in Uttarakhand.</description>
