      <description>As we were leaving Paris it seems our friends (whom we knew for a shortwhile) has to give something as a memento. Gifts were extravagant andreally worth mentioning as they chose something which we adore.
To start with gift Pamela got from Fran√ßois is very special. I am sureshe can write a new post about the same. I am just going to give youbrief detail on the same.</description>
