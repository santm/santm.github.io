      <description>This year we didn&amp;rsquo;t celebrate Aarush B&amp;rsquo;day as we moved to ourown apartment. Being new to complex we hardly knew anyone to invite.Sodecided to celebrate his B&amp;rsquo;day at school which he of-course didn&amp;rsquo;t likemuch as he didn&amp;rsquo;t receive any gifts and top of it he has to give returngifts to his school mates….which he did so with heavy heart.
We decided to take him to Dubare elephantcamp.</description>
