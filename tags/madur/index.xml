Vythiri resort. Lakidi is about 2 km south of Chain Tree and is the
gateway of Wayanad which is on highway to Calicut. It is a ghat pass at
an elevation of 700m above sea level.We crossed Kalpetta and drove
mostly on NH 212.
Overwhelmed with scenery as this highway is heaven on this earth , a
beautiful place with lot of tea gardens on the way.</description></item></channel></rss>
