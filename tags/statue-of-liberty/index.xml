      <description>Continuing from Madurai(2010-December); we setup the alarm clock to ensure we do not miss thesunrise. But to our surprise we were awaken early by anxiety andwhispers from the corridors. We went to see if the Sun was rising soonbut the horizon was dark and there was faint rays of light. We letAarush sleep and went to the rooftop where we saw every hotel rooftop isfull of people as all are waiting for the Sun-rise.</description>
