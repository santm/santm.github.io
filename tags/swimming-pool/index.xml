      <description>During April and May Aarush and Pamela went to Swimming pool almostdaily for a few weeks. Every day around 10:30 or so he would make hisbest effort to get his swimming gear and would ask us to put it for him.But after few weeks we had to stop as we realized his cough was notgetting cured and he got lots of sun tan. And now after the operation heis out of scope for any water sports for next one year.</description>
