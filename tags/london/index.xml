S.Rushdie ) for five days. We stayed as guest of Sampath, at his home
bit outside of London. The trip would not have been so pleasant and
memorable without his help and warm hospitality.
We reached around noon at Waterloo station by Eurostar. After keeping
our luggage at cloak room we went straight to London Eye. It was a
nice start to see all the monuments of London from birds view.</description></item></channel></rss>
