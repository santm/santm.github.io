Somehow during the planning phase we found it was overshooting our
budget. And moreover, was advised against it during late April &amp;amp; Early
May as there is a high chances of rain during that time. So we had no
plan and no places to visit while we are going to be in Siliguri for
10/12 days.
We called one travel agent in Calcutta from train and told him about our
requirement and he said he would be able to put an itinerary of 6 nights
( 2nights Sikkim, 2 Kursuang and 2 in Darjeeling).</description></item><item><title>Sikkim - Gangtok</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2006-05-21-sikkim-gangtok/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 May 2006 16:34:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2006-05-21-sikkim-gangtok/</guid><description>My current home in India is Siliguri, north of West Bengal may not
be the most alluring for tourist destinations. But it is the most
important city in the entire Eastern Himalayas due to its geographical
location. As city is unabashedly an industrial centre and gateway to
seven sisters of North-East along with Sikkim &amp;amp; eastern part of Nepal.
My parents moved here ten years back and by that time I had just started
my career; never had ample holidays to explore any thing around.</description></item></channel></rss>
