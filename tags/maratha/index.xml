lord Shiva)- marked with devotion to one of most powerful lord in Hindu
mythology. While Shiv jayanti (Birthday) is celebration of birth
anniversary of Shivaji Maharaj who ruled Maratha region in 17th
century fighting against powerful Mughal Empire of North-India. He was
named Shiva, after the local Goddess Shivai, to whom his mother Jijabai
had prayed for a son.</description></item><item><title>Viva Goa - Adios</title><link>https://santm.com/posts/2007-04-18-viva-goa-adios/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Apr 2007 05:04:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://santm.com/posts/2007-04-18-viva-goa-adios/</guid><description>[](http://www.santm.com/gallery3/index.php/2007/goa/mixed/reflexation-nerul-river)![](../images/2007-04-18-viva-goa-adios-mirror-view.jpg)
Last day, woke up very early in the morning to visit Candolim, Sinquerim
beach- Just to avoid scorching heat of sun. The shimmering sea stretches
to the horizon. Spent some time to savour the view then headed to Fort
Aguada. Fort Agauda crowns the rocky flattened headland at the end of
the beach. Constructed in 1612 to protect the northern shores of Mandovi
estuary from Dutch and Maratha raiders. It was a reference point for the
vessels coming from Europe at that time.</description></item></channel></rss>
