Encountered this perfect parking on a small by-lane in Bangalore. For
sure I will not be able to park like this; normally have enough
difficulties in parallel parking on the street between cars. I was
failed (fatal) as rear tire touched the ramp in my first attempt to
secure Californian driving License. Looks like the owner will not be
change car as this is customized parking only which can accommodate
small car.
