After basking last 4 years in Bay Area we moved to Paris. The weather
was bleak cold which almost blew me off as we were getting in to the
TAXI at the airport. Reached hotel without problem, had a Chinese female
driver speaking English. Exhausted and tired to reach work which looked
like a 5 minutes walk from hotel on map. But, got lost in concrete
jungle of **La Defense** which is one of the unique place with
concentrated modern high-rise buildings in Europe. With out realizing
found **La Grande Arche** which was right in front of my nose. After
asking several people and at last police which was no good for me to
reach work that evening.
