Yes these are my dirty shoes. Not very sure about the origin of those
shoe laces, I got them when my old office was getting closed. Missing
the TIBX bus and shares I got those laces :( (People got nice race cars
and big houses in Bay Area a dream come true in this materialistic world
and what I got for boarding the train late. Well I have another pair of
these laces…..

  

Unless any big shoot TIBX one day decide to run a charity marathon with
these laces on his gizmo running shoes there is no real value to the
other pair of laces I have. Any one out there …. You know I am sure it
will not cost much.
