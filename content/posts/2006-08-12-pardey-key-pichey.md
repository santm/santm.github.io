From a good friend of mine I got an offer to help at backstage of **Ritu
Beri’s** fashion show to be held at Paris on 5th July at *Lido*. At
first I wanted to deny this proposal but with second thought that it
might be a fun with friends to be there; I nodded my head giving my
approval. Ace fashion designer Ritu Beri is the first Asian to have
joined a French fashion house making a slow transition from Indian Haute
Couture to Prêt-a-porter (ready to wear).

  

Believe me, it was only 30 minutes affair in 1 hour show the work was
just to help models dressed in mélange of Indo-western meticulously
designed outfits. The dresses along with accessories and shoes were
properly tagged and kept ready for each model. As there is barely a gap
of 15 seconds in which one has to change and be back on the ramp. So
each of us were allotted with one particular model to help them in
changing and getting dressed. Even sometimes the fitting may not be
proper which needs special attention from Ritu’s assistant to get them
stitched or tucked at last moment.

  

One can read Ritu’s face that how much stressed she was at that point of
time but however she made it….bravura. For me, although not being a
spectator it was no less fun being at back peeping through curtains to
get the glimpse of the stage and making comments.

As my co-helpers forgot their camera, I was persuaded to take photos and
in that process I ended up taking more photos then I thought. Thanks to
all those unknown models to pose for someone amateur like me.

Anywayz, for that 30minutes help we were all given a token of gratitude
from her collection “**sequined crushed silk top**”.

Though, this event took place in July first week and I posted the
pictures in the
[gallery](http://www.santm.com/gallery3/index.php/paris/fashionshow)
that very day but as I didn't got an opportunity to wear the top so kept
pushing this post on backburner till today.
