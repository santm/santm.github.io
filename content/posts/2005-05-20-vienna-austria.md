We just finished uploading pictures from our Vienna trip to our site. It
was a great trip. Only complain was the hotel which was really outside
of city without any proper public transport. The hotel was “Novotel” and
we preferred it as we got good treatment from this hotel chain for our
trips to Amsterdam and Berlin. When we booked the same it was mentioned
it has Metro next to it. But in real world the metro station is 5 or 6
KM away and there is a bus which runs every one or two hours between the
metro station and the hotel.  

The evening we reached was bit late around 11PM so I decided to take a
cab from the airport to the hotel. The hotel people told me it cost
around 35 euros from the Airport to the hotel. But it cost us 54 Euros
so I was very angry with the Taxi driver at first for taking longer
routes. But when I asked again with the hotel guy he said it is normally
around 60 Euros. Well that made me feel good but not better.  

Next day, Saturday, we went to Melk by train from Vienna the weather was
great with blue sky and warm temperature. The train ride was nice as it
gives a good view of Austria’s country side. Melk has a very beautiful
abbey which is known as Stift to the local. From there we took a boat
ride on Danube River to Kermes. While walking from the boat stop to the
train station we met a lady from Graz. She suggested us to take the
train ride to her beautiful town in the Alps on any sunny morning.  

That evening we came back to Vienna and walked around StephansPlatz and
dined in a vegetarian place, the food was good.  

Sunday we had our coffee and some tasty pastries to start the day. We
walked along the ring starting from Opera, Hufburg Palace, City hall,
Museum Quarter Parliament, University and the stock Market. After that
we went to St. Augustine’s Church to listen the Sunday Chores. It was a
very different experience the music and singing was really very soothing
to ears. After lunch we went to Belvedere Palace. It was very special
day as Austria was celebrating its 50 years of Freedom. There was live
music, dance in different form. We really enjoyed those great outdoor
performances.  

On our last day we went to Schonbrunn (beautiful fountain) palace. It
was summer residence of the royal. Its beautiful park really demands a
good amount of time from you to explore those lavish green
surroundings.  

Well that brought to an end and we were back to the airport for our
afternoon flight to Paris.
