My addiction to coffee is old an old one. My morning does not start
without coffee on weekdays. I am **not quite human** still have my
morning coffee will probably describe it best.  In India coffee is very
different from West.  I came to know recently that Indian Coffee Board
is head quartered in Bangalore.  The main coffee producing region of
India(*hills of Coorg, Niligiris and Wayanad*&gt;) are not very far off
Bangalore.

  

This coffee I got today morning while on way to office. [A good link to

Some quote from
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_filter_coffee) about how
it is prepared if you are interested.

  

> South Indian coffee is brewed with a metal device that resembles two
> cylindrical cups, one of which has a pierced bottom that nests into
> the top of the "tumbler" cup, leaving ample room underneath to receive
> the brewed coffee. The upper cup has two removable parts: a pierced
> pressing disc with a central stem handle, and a covering lid.The upper
> cup is loaded with fresh ground coffee mixed with chicory (~2
> tablespooons of mixture per serving). The grounds are gently
> compressed with the stemmed disc into a uniform layer across the cup's
> pierced bottom. With the press disc left in place, the upper cup is
> nested into the top of the tumbler and boiling water is poured inside.
> The lid is placed on top, and the device is left to slowly drip the
> brewed coffee into the bottom. The chicory sort of holds on to the hot
> water a little longer, letting the water extract more flavor from the
> coffee powder. This makes the decoction a lot stronger as compared the
> typical western drip coffee, the decoction is so strong that you'd
> need only 2-3 tea spoonfuls of it to flavor a 150ml milk. Where as the
> western drip coffee is quite watery to taste.
