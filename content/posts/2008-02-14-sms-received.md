As I said before I went to hospital on d-day with my Laptop and all
cables needed for announcing the arrival of Aarush. Few starring eyes
caught me in action when I did fired-up SMS from my laptop. There was no
way I could have managed sending all SMS(es) by phone only. So, I had to
send SMS in batches : one to my professional contacts, other to extended
family and rest to Pamela's contact list. It was very smooth experience
with [MyPhoneExplorer](http://www.fjsoft.at/en/).

Here are [all the congrats
SMS](http://blog.santm.com/p/sms-received-for-aarush.html) we received

I am a big fan and advocate of Open Software who gets his morning coffee
reading [Slashdot](http://www.slashdot.org/) but normally I did not have
great experience with all the free software that I use daily. I highly
recommend MyPhoneExplorer if you are using any Sony Ericsson phone
except the symbian-based phones (P-series, M600, W950).
