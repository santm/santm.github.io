The first thing that struck me about Rajasthan was its roads when I last
went in 2000 with my parents. Rajasthan roads are amazing; and they are
very well connected interms of bus, train, private cars, even one can
hire cars to drive around between different places with in state. This
makes travelling in Rajasthan quite safe and less tiring. With good road
conditions you can also explore the interiors of Rajasthan.

This fact remains same even today when I visited with my family on oct.
2010. The time from Oct to December is considered ideal to visit
Rajasthan, though its high tourist season. One major drawback is they
will make feel Indian tourists discriminated infront of westners as they
get Tips in foreign currency.

Rajasthan is full of great eating out options from the regular highway
dhabas to the most luxurious hotels in India. They have very rich
culture interms of dress colour, turbans- they have more than 1000 types
and styles of doing the turban, the variations depending on the region,
casteand creed  in the society. An array of instruments such
as *sarangi*, *ektara, dhol, chang* etc are used to create melodious
tunes  as well as variations in folk dances. Camel safari is “must do”
 depends if across Thar then its a great way to explore the vastness of
the desert. Once you like the culture you feel like pluging deeper and
getting mesmerised.

Being  one of the tourist hub it is highly commercialized in almost
every aspect of its existence. There are many remote areas mostly
nomadic villages, where entertaining the tourists is the only form of
livelihood that can be thought of. Also, all tourist attractions charge
for photography and videography which is worth but surprising thing is
difference in prices for foreigner and indian tourist.

Another thing which I like about this place is they know business very
well. If you go for shopping and think that certain thing may have to
pay extra at airport then ofcourse you can opt for their courier service
which they will do for free. But be aware, certain times complain are
there that they send defective piece or change the fabric which you have
opted for after it's INDIA where everything can happen.

Santanu is so impressed that he wants to travel again to Rajasthan but
with different route probably - Bikaner, Mt.Abu ,Udaipur,
Chittorgarh,Kota,Bundi, Ranthambore, Agra back to Jaipur. One thing I
would like to add here is with no. of days we have spent there we could
have easily covered Bikaner.
