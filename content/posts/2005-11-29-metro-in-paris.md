Living in Paris and not travelling in Metro has lots of demerits. Like
usual I am going to start with the traffic jams, one way roads,
unavailability of parking, high parking tickets and very unusual sense
of **Parisian driving skills**.

  

These only list if you have a car and travelling of your own. But what
about those who are taking other mode of smart transports like Bus,
Tram, Bicycle, Rollerblade or just walk to work or work from home? Well,
looking at the list they look cool-nice with their own merits and
demerits. For example, I used to go to work in summer by bike, it was
the quickest mode to reach work with no major traffic. And I used to
go-through Bois-de-Boulogne to have some exercise and fresh air.

  

But wait, I have not listed demerits yet for these mode of transport
over Metro. You will have no clue about what is coming up or going on
social front like which ***movie*** or ***big concert*** as metro walls
list all those for you. You never know when there is ***“SALE”*** coming
up from ***Galeries Lafayette*** to any electronics stores. Not only
that you will also miss what is the latest trend in the fashion from
shoes to eyeglasses.

  

This list can be long. In short, if you are not noticing the metro walls
& people while walking those long passages between different metro lines
you miss a lot ;)
