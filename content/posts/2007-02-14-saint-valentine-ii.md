As [I said lots of thoughts were coming
across](http://blog.santm.com/2007/02/14/saint-valentine/) in spite of
my busy-ness. So first was to ask Pamela to come over at *Fort area* for
lunch which was denied by her saying that lots of household chores left
to be done. Then again I modified my plan and asked her to join at
evening for dinner when she told me she won’t as without any prior
booking no food will be available at any good restaurant because of that
day- which is in fact quite true.

Despite of her denial I didn’t left any hope I ended up saying we will
go somewhere outside for sure. With passage of time I got busier in work
and stuck for long hrs. When I almost realized that there is no chance
of dinner outside. But, somehow I finished my work by seven and left for
home. I reached home at half past nine when I was to take my shower and
then leave so another 30 min. gone. By the time we got into car it was
around ten so on the way we decided to have our dinner at **Bombay
Blues, Center-One - Vashi**. On reaching the restaurant the doorman said
with smile it will take 40 minutes minimum to get a seat. So, we took a
stroll around other shops. Even after 40 min. there was no luck so we
stood at door only waiting for our turn. After 11 we had luck to have
our seat; now it was time to place order..... since it was enormously
crowded so one can guess quality of service and food to expect. Somehow
around 11.40 got something on plate.

  

I ordered for *Chicken sizzler* which looks awesome to hungry stomach
but awful to taste. Never heard Chinese food being served with cheese so
was that plate. My god! somehow survived with Pamela’s plate and
appetizer.

Learnt a lesson that *never to go for dinning without prior reservation
or it’s much better to enjoy and relish food at home only especially on
V-day*. All these can be explained with the new economic growth that
Indian higher middle class are enjoying at this moment, and everyone
from mega-malls to jewelers to flower shop or even food-stalls are
cashing in.
