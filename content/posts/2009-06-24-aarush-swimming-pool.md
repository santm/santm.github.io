During April and May Aarush and Pamela went to Swimming pool almost
daily for a few weeks. Every day around 10:30 or so he would make his
best effort to get his swimming gear and would ask us to put it for him.
But after few weeks we had to stop as we realized his cough was not
getting cured and he got lots of sun tan. And now after the operation he
is out of scope for any water sports for next one year.
