Our trip to Switzerland has ended after all those C.B.G (châteaux,
bateaux and gateaux) trips around Europe but indeed it was a different
experience altogether. It is all about the greenery, mountain streams
rushing along, water falls, snow clad mountains, sounds of cow-bells
tickling on the alpine meadows.

I am not sure if every one is happy with their first trip to a new place
or not. But, I am always very happy and excited to go to new places. I
always live with some desire or feeling that was not filled in that very
trip. It keeps me motivated to go back to the same place once again. May
be it is my way of exploring and traveling.

The beauties of all those places we have been in Switzerland are so vast
that I think - “I can explore them for years to come if I am there all
the time”. But I know that is not going to happen (soon for sure!).

Here are few things that one should not miss while traveling in
Switzerland – starting with what we missed.

-   <span class="orange">A Video Camera a MUST along with normal camera
    – to capture the Alpine divinity while traveling in train (specially
    for those panoramic one)</span>
-   Ask for window seat if your train needs reservation.
-   Hiking Pole – if you are hiking and that includes downhill.
-   Make sure your watch is giving correct and precise time - the
    train/bus leaves platform on dot. To demonstrate this you just wait
    on a platform you will find the train starts moving as soon as the
    time posted and time on the big clock on the platform matches.A good
    pair of hiking shoes if you plan to walk a lot.
-   Warm clothes even in summer for going to the top of the mountains.
-   Good sunglass – Normal sunglass only stops little compared to those
    special glacier sunglass, you need them to save your eyes from the
    reflected sunlight from glacier at high altitude.
-   Polaroid filter -for your camera if you happen to be lucky on the
    mountain top with clear blue sky.
