Kaziranga is one of the bigger National Park of India. It has three
prominent zones - Central, Western and Eastern.

  

**Central Range** -- This drive covers the central region of the park.
It is an ideal introduction to the park and its ecology as the route
passes through the entire spectrum of habitat types prevalent in the
Kaziranga area. (though Brahmaputra view is not available, a stretch of
the route goes by the tributary river Difloo) There is a possibility of
sighting elephants as well as the other big animals especially the swamp
buffalo and of course the rhino. In the extensive short grass yards next
to the wetlands the rare Swamp Deer. <span class="underline">Swamp Deer
is more endangered than the Asian one-horned rhino as far as the world
population is concerned.</span> Birding is possible in a wide range of
habitats.

  

**Western Range** -- From Wild Grass, it takes 20 minutes by jeep to
reach the entrance of this Range. The route traverses the southwest
portion of the park. This range has maximum short grass areas and is the
optimum habitat for Rhino and Water buffaloes The **Dunga Tower**
presents a panorama of short grass edged wetland, patches of tall
grassland and woodland in with such visual setting animals can be
sighted in a landscape representing their appropriate habitat. Part of
the drive is also through Low Alluvial Savannah Woodland. Colonization
of grassland by Lagerstroemia trees can be seen.

  

**Eastern (Agaratuli) Range --***S*ituated towards the eastern part of
the park, less frequented *(<span class="underline">we did not go there
ourselves)</span>*. The area is excellent for birding. Many water birds
can be observed at **Sohola Beel**. Various woodland birds can be seen
along the drive through very scenic Dillenia Swamp Forest. Elephants may
be encountered, as well as Water Buffalo and Swamp Deer. Takes 30
minutes to reach from Wild Grass. Part of the route gives an idea of the
Brahmaputra river (only tourist route that goes partly by the river).
One can do a boat ride in the northeastern point of the Park.

  

  

**The Kaziranga National Orchid & Biodiversity Park**, located in
Durgapur village off the National Highway(37) itself. It offers a very
benign recreational activity. It is about 3 km of walkable distance from
Wild Grass. Besides the outdoor orchids, the greenhouse is manned by
personnel adept at orienting and interpreting the rare orchids of NE
region The Park has a large array of medicinal plants as also varied
species of bamboo groves. A day-long cultural program makes the place
lively and a selection of <span class="underline">folk dances of
different communities</span> and tribes of the hills and valley of Assam
is continually performed. The Bamboo dance is very special. <span
class="underline">Ethnic thali having as much as 18 to 26 food
items</span> is available for lunch and early dinner. There are other
exhibit areas apart from the orchid display areas in this property.
Apart from the photo gallery of orchids, the exhibit areas are all
evolving into a storehouse of the tangible folk cultural properties of
the various communities of Assam. Diverse implements produced out of the
necessities of the everyday daily life of the peasants and farmers of
different regions of the Brahmaputra Valley help any visitor to
understand the material folk cultural forms of the Assam area.

area is part of the addition to Kaziranga National Park. Scrubland some
forty years ago it was under afforestation management practice for
fast-growing tree plantation but the low lying areas (now grassland )
were found uneconomical for tree planting. Part of this Range has areas
having ideal wet grassland habitat attributes for transient animals from
Kaziranga National Park. Kaziranga management was In a search of more
areas for the ecological integrity of Kaziranga NP and with this in view
the Ghorakati area, as well as the hilly Kukrakata Reserve Forest, has
been annexed to Kaziranga. And only a little over a decade ago has been
opened to visitors. <span class="underline">*Again we have not visited
this part ourselves.*</span>
