Our [old faithful I-podâ€™s](http://blog.santm.com/2004/03/got-ipod.html)
battery died last year; nothing to complain about the same. We have used
it enough and did not have any complain. Only thing that happened is the
battery started to loose charge more often and at the end it stopped
charging altogether. Just after I got this I-Pod, Apple had to [settle a
lawsuit](http://www.macobserver.com/article/2005/06/02.11.shtml) for low
quality batteries. That way I must say I am happy to survive for 3 years
with one battery.

  

I was not looking at spending 4,000 INR (100 USD) to replace the battery
by Apple. The thing I do not like about this program is - Apple does not
return your own I-Pod rather they give you a similar one from their
stock. So I opted for changing the battery myself. It cost only 20 USD
to get the new battery and after spending 15 minutes I was able to hit
the road again.

The kit contains two plastic openers without which opening the case is
almost impossible. The demo video included in the kit is informative; if
they had shown how to create the first opening in slow motion and in
closeup it would have been much better. As this was my first time I cut
my finger with one of those plastic hinge openers. You really need to be
careful with these tools. I had to use a small metal screwdriver to
widen the gap between front and back case. After opening the case,
removing the hard-drive and replacing the battery was very easy for me.
I was very careful to make sure all connections were correct
particularly for hard-drive and docking station. I did not have to open
the case again as all the connections were perfect.
