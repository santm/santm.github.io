Watched lots of movies, uploaded some photos to
[Running](http://www.flickr.com/photos/santm/sets/72157638606195706) and
walked around Paris last week.

  
New in gallery - bibs from running . Well you must be wondering what is
that ? For a person like me from whom the activity of sport was taken
away by various pressures at young age it means a lot. The good side of
it is that I am the very few fortunate one to run at this age at various
places but rest remains as silent voice in vast population of India.

  

Tried lots of combination for uploading video to my website and found
due to some mismatch between my Digital Camera and computer I could not
get the precise result for which I was looking. Here is one from Paris -
Metro. These are the few of those musicians who play for free inside the
metro. Some of them are great who just play as they try to get a good
number of audiences. Especially in Chatlet; the most crossed metro stop
by people as it is the bull-eye of paris Metro Network. Rest plays for
small money in the metro compartment and that some times sound hard on
ears.
