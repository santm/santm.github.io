After getting over with jetlag went to OMI for my medical visit next
morning. It was OK. Tried Metro for the first time (Parlez vous Anglais)
worked. BTW this medical vist is must before any one starts working in
French. But all that good time was so short lived as we reached Cite
Police Prefecture. A very big old building in front of Notre Dame in
center Paris. This is the H.Q. for all civilian work. So lots of people
were in queue. Here no on speaks anything other than French and they are
least bothered about what you are trying to say either.
