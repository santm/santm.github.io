Cricket – is India’s gorgeous past time – it is not taken as a sport.
This picture was taken during **Cricket World Cup of 2007** inside a
Mumbai cab. But somehow I never posted the same. I am not a big cricket
fan but is impossible to avoid cricket while you are in India.

In recent time, performance of Indian cricket team is quite
disappointing. But that does not change Indians breathing cricket - be
at India or abroad. Performance of India in any other sport is quite
dishonorable considering its population.

Cricket and cricketers are most sought after in India. Best Indian
performance of cricket in world arena was almost 20 years back when
there was not so much glamour and money in that game. May be that is why
they were more interested in playing cricket rather than endorsing any
brand or product.

The worst of all is the Indian cricket board which is most money milking
sport’s body in the world even beating those big football clubs of
Europe. **Chairs of Indian Cricket Board are filled up with politicians
and old cricketers whose greed for money, power and limelight or
Page-Three attention never ends.** Enough of ranting …..for something
which I don’t even care.
