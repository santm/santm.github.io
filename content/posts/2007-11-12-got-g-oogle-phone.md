Well downloaded **G-Phone** application from
[Google.](http://mobile.google.com/) on my Blackberry. All I needed was
data access enabled phone to download **G-phone**. The speculation was
running high about a new hardware from Google in lots of web sites. Lets
see how these applications (Gmail, Google maps, Google news, Google
search, Gtalk, Google calender) will work on a normal phone where the
display is not as big as Blackberry and you do not have full keyboard or
track wheel. Any feedback on that, have you tried already ?
