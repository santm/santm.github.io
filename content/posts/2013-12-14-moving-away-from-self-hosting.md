Well after all these years of self hosting and WordPress I am kind of
let go the Self-hosting. Moved
[pamela.santm.com](http://pamela.santm.com/) to Tumblr and all the
pictures from Gallery3 to
[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/santm/sets/).Â 

  

Still need to move www.santm.com somewhere and aarush.santm,com pictures
to somewhere, most likely it will be Flickr again. hope to complete the
all these before 2013 finishes.
