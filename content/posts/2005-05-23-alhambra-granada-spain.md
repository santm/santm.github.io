We did not book our tickets for Alhambra before coming to Granada. There
can be 8,000 visitors inside Alhambra in a given day. Out of those 8,000
around 6,500 are sold over internet & phone. So for us, it meant getting
up early and queuing up in the morning. As it was Monday and not peak of
tourist season... we were lucky.

<span style="text-align: justify;">Alhambra has main 4 sites to visit.
The main attraction is of course "Palacios Nazaries" the best preserved
Moorish Palace in Europe. The palace is quite intact from all the wars
that were fought between Christians and Moorish (Arab Muslim from North
Africa). The war ended at 1429. I heard lots of tour guides mostly
Japanese comparing this to Taj Mahal. As I have never been to Taj Mahal
I can not say for certain but I am quite sure it is not that close to
Taj Mahal in beauty. Still the works of Moorish artists are really very
appreciable.</span>  
  

We spent a good amount of time in Palacios Nazaries, from there we went
to Generalife via beautiful garden of roses. From there we visited
'Palace of Charles V' and 'Alcazaba'. This makes the four attraction of
Alhambra.

  

After siesta, we went to the Cathedral and walked around there. That
evening while strolling we came across Mexican Restaurant - "Chile
Grande". The food was really excellent which reminded me of my
Californian days.
