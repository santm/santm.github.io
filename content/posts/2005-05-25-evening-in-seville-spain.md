Back from Cordoba around 4PM in the afternoon to Seville. We went to buy
ticket for next phase of journey that was between Seville and Lisbon.
Oh! That was too hot and sweating experience to summarize in short. Back
to hotel being boiled with afternoon heat we got freshen up.

We started our evening stroll starting from Puente de San Telmo towards
Triana around 9PM, the other side of the river a common Seville
neighborhood. On our way we saw the ‘Torre del Oro’. After a while went
to a tapas bar which was crowded with local people. Here the server
notes down your order and price with a chalk in front of you on the desk
while you have your food standing. Around midnight we left Triana as we
could not find any flamenco music sounds. This is the only thing which
we could not listen to in this trip of ours. We came back walking near
to cathedral and took picture of the bell tower (in night mode). At this
hour city was still crowded with tourists as well as locals giving a
feeling that night is still young.
