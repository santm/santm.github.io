Trying to jazz up [skittlish theme of
wordpress](http://journal.barleyhut.com/the-skittlish-theme-for-wordpress/)
with [silk icon sets from
famfamfam.com.](http://www.famfamfam.com/archive/silk-icons-thats-your-lot/)
In recent time there is new version of skittlish supporting widgets so I
thought it might be a god starting ground. Best part - for few colors
(red, orange, green & blue) there are icons available for tag, user
(author). But for rest there is none. As I am not a graphic person not
sure how should I go forward. Any expert out there to help me ;). Plan
to release my best by next week.
