Continuing from [Madurai](http://blog.santm.com/2011/05/04/madurai/)
(2010-December); we setup the alarm clock to ensure we do not miss the
sunrise. But to our surprise we were awaken early by anxiety and
whispers from the corridors. We went to see if the Sun was rising soon
but the horizon was dark and there was faint rays of light. We let
Aarush sleep and went to the rooftop where we saw every hotel rooftop is
full of people as all are waiting for the Sun-rise. After some wait the
magnificent sunrise did happen but it was quite late around 6.30am but
worth watching. [This is a small video of the
same](http://youtu.be/Cx0i0X5gpOI).

After a very ordinary breakfast in one of the small stall we went to see
Vivekananda Rock Memorial and Thiruvalluvar Statue, a Indian version of
the Statue of Liberty . It was 8:30 in the morning in December but the
Sun was really hot, it was quite along queue for ferry ride to that spot
but worth going. When we reached Rock Memorial the Sun was on full blast
it became tough to move around with bear foot.

  
Thiruvalluvar is ancient Tamil poet who lived almost two thousand years
back. His work is part of everyday Tamil life but not very known beyond
South India. This huge statue definitely stole all the limelight in the
southern tip of mainland India. Personally felt it too huge and little
eye-sore but again that I my personal view.

On return from ferry ride we came to hotel it was noon and
Kanyakumari(Virgin goddess) temple was closed. We had to wait till 4PM
for it to reopen or move forward. After temples of Madurai and
Rameshwarm I was bit tired of temple queues. And in this temple all
males must enter only in dhoti (the traditional Indian dress) and
shirtless. So we escaped Kanyakumari Temple, located on the shore and
headed towards next spot â€“ Kovalam.(target was to reach before sunset).
