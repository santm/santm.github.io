We moved from Paris to Bombay. Yes it is a big event in our life and we
are still not sure whether things will fall in place at the end or not.
We are trying our destiny – but we are not sure what will be there for
us???????? Well lots of questions and raising eye-brows from friends and
families.

  

  
But this post is not about why we left Paris and why moved to India. It
is all about how we spent our last one week in Paris. Before leaving, we
wanted to take pictures of those which makes Paris so desired
destination for tourists. No doubt it is one of the most visited place
in the world be it for Eiffel Tower or Champs Elysees.

  
As our time for departure was coming close we tried to visit few of the
well known
[Brasseries](http://www.santm.com/gallery3/index.php/paris/eatingout/p1010012)
or Bistros to hidden street corners to
[passages](http://www.flickr.com/photos/santm/sets/72157638610234795)
away from busy tourist area. We did our best, but weather was not very
happy with our move and unexpectedly August was very grey with clouds
and rain all those thirty-one days. It is a month when almost every
thing stands still in Paris or France from bakery to fashion-store to
office- “tout le monde”. As every one heads towards sea “au bord de la
mer” for getting “bronzee” sun bathing. If you come back from vacation
with out noticeable change in color your vacation is not well spent.

  
Not only, we took lots of pictures and uploaded to [**our
gallery**](http://www.flickr.com/photos/santm/) but we reorganized them.
It was very long and meticulous process with thousands of pictures to
sort and write their details as much as possible. In a way it was great
to know more about Paris. All credit goes to Pamela for the same. With
less than 16 hours to go before the movers were to arrive I rushed to
[La Defense](http://www.flickr.com/photos/santm/sets/72157638609685834)
to take pictures, 

  
YES!! It was crazy but its worth for people like me (amateur
photographer) as it allowed me to capture those tall buildings with blue
sky after washed by rain.

  
Although, I am not sure if any one going to visit Paris is going to read
this post and check our pictures or not. But, somehow I got a feeling of
“been there – did this…did that…” and I am very content from heart for
the same

  
As we spent our last two days in cleaning after the movers left before
handing over our apartment keys to our landlord. In this process with
lots of small things to be done on other hand at last moment like
closing the bank account, getting official papers from office etc. we
got so tired and exhausted that we could not effort any long to run and
take pictures of “Parisians in roller blade”.

  
This post is getting bit longer than I thought so I will split the last
few days and hours in another one. Keep reading ….
