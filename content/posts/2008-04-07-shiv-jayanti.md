**“Shiv jayanti”** should not be confused with **Shivratri** *(Night of
lord Shiva)*- marked with devotion to one of most powerful lord in Hindu
mythology. While Shiv jayanti (Birthday) is celebration of birth
anniversary of **Shivaji Maharaj** who ruled Maratha region in 17th
century fighting against powerful Mughal Empire of North-India. He was
named Shiva, after the local Goddess Shivai, to whom his mother Jijabai
had prayed for a son.

According to English calendar, birthday of Shivaji is on February 19th.
But ShivSena, the main political party of regional party in Maharashtra
celebrates the same according to Indian astronomical dates. In Mumbai,
you can’t miss this day which is celebrated with its colors and
festivity. A colorful procession with lezims (a traditional musical
instrument) is taken around the city. The main gathering happens at
Shivaji Park of Dadar in the evening. You will find saffron triangular
flags fluttering everywhere from train station to cabs on this day.

But there are some down side of this celebration to common people. If
you have to travel around Dadar or need to cross the central part of
this maximum city be prepared for a evening crawl. On the main roads as
soon as you see on your rear-view mirror a big speeding SUV with flags
you need to give right of way. The priority to this kind of vehicle is
more than any emergency vehicle; it also signals *‘do not dare to touch
me or stop me’* to law enforcement officials. With recent split of
ShivSena this time there were cars from both parties to show their power
and dedication to Shivaji Maharaj. Not sure if Shivaji would have
appreciating the same. This is one of these celebrations which have been
hijacked by political parties to show who rules the city - **‘Asli Bhai
Kaun Hai’.**
