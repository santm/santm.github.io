In last 20 months “**change**” was one of most used word thanks to new
President elect Obama. I admire the way he delivers speeches and uses
words. Most reporters must be missing those malapropian phrases used in
last 8 years.

I took this picture in February at Mumbai Airport; personally I too was
thinking about the change and transition I was going trough at work and
home at that time. A long waited post with little details but again the
line from Gandhi says it all.
