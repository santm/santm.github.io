Somewhere on the internet once read the need for ***a vacation within a
vacation***. I know it sounds oxymoron but trust me when you are on the
road for some time you need a day or two just doing nothing. Majuli was
supposed to a magical place for us.

  

As we drove back west from Sivsagar we took the diversion to
**Nematighat**, the boat embarkation point (ferry ghat) to go to Majuli.
In recent times Majuli has lost its size due to many floods but it still
holds the record for the largest river island.

  

We thought the drive from the highway to the ferry point would be quick,
but it was a long one. The last 2 KM we drove on the bank of the river
Brahmaputra and it was fine white sand all over. Even though we were not
driving at very fast speed there was a sand storm on our back. As we
approached the ferry we queued up for the cars to be placed on the next
boat. Now, these are small boats which carry passengers, bikes and cars.
But space for a car is limited and if the boat is even smaller it could
be only 2 cars at a time.

Lucky for us the car in front of us broke down, they were trying their
best to put that car. But Pamela smartly managed the situation and said
if they are having so much tough time putting the car on the boat how
they will get it out on the other side? Now putting up the car on the
boat is not easy, we deftly drove the car down the slushy, scary-steep
incline and stopped at the edge of a makeshift jetty on the river and
there two wooden planks, almost as narrow as the tires, between the
jetty and a country boat. But those guys were extra helpful as they
realized we are a tourist. The cars are parked next to each other barely
a few inches gap between them and it seems it is a norm to keep the car
door unlocked.

The seating space was very packed as well many travelers were on the top
of the roof which provides better ventilation, but it was noon and we
opted out of it. The boat ride is about an hour plus and there was an
intermediate stop before Majuli. Once we landed in Majuli and got our
car out we waited for the other cars and local taxi/tempos and we
started towards our hotel.

  

Majuli welcomes us with its rustic beauty. There are only a few major
roads that connect within the island. We stopped at **Ural restaurant**
we found along the road and simple rice plate in the Assamese style.

  

Our stay was at **Deka Chang**, the place is supposed to be one of the
best ones in Majuli. It even gets featured in the *Priyanka Chopra’s
promo video of Assam tourism*. We got ourselves a very big room which
was not needed. But it was due to the fact some government official was
staying while he was on official vacation. This stay of the official
caused us very poor service. And we were disappointed and cursing
ourselves for choosing this property.

  

In the evening we visited the nearby temple (Satra). This Satra is very
special as it runs by family members. It is called **Garamur Satra**.

  

**Satras** are **Vaishnav temple** and they are very special to <span
class="underline">Assam’s history and culture</span>. Just to highlight
few facts about Majuli

-   The first newspaper of Assam was published here.
-   Sankaradeva established the first Satra here.
-   Here you will find the largest tribal community of Assam the
    Misings.
-   Even though there all religious people stay on this island there is
    no mosque. It is just to show respect and great community living.

  

After observing the evening prayer at the Satra we had dinner at the
same place where we had lunch and called it a day.
