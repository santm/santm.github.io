[![](../images/thumbnails/2008-05-02-goodbye-mumbai-a-quick-update-Mumbai-hub-of-india.jpg)](../images/2008-05-02-goodbye-mumbai-a-quick-update-Mumbai-hub-of-india.jpg)I
did not want to use a title like **“Welcome to Bangalore**” or **“Here I
come to Bangaloru”** on purpose as need some time before I can call this
my new home. From long time we were knowing that we have to move to
Banglore but on personal grounds I had to postpone it which was readily
accepted by my company. In recent months, I was waiting for that green
signal from my company that I have to move in any case.

At last, on Sunday (27th April) I partially moved; travelling from
Mumbai to Bangalore in my car covering 955KM in 20 hours. The experience
of that journey deserves a post of its own. I hope to write on that as
soon as I find a suitable place to rent and settle myself a bit.
