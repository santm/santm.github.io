The biggest asset of 21st century modern India is its big chunk of young
educated Indian who can speak decent English. There is lot of buzz and
business happening in India as there are numerous outsourcing
operations.

But on the ground we speak very different English with borrowed words
from Indian regional languages that do find their way into our writing,
advertisements and newspapers, TV spots and shows from north to south or
east to west.

For example, in south it is very common to end a sentence with “**no**”
– ‘*You’re going, no.*’ which might be a question or asking re-assurance
from the other end.  

Use of **yaar, abey, arey** in an English conversation between Indians,
mainly by people of native Hindi-speaking origin.

Use of the word **ki** to mean, that such as in "*What I mean is ki we
should follow that sign*.”

Use of word "**wallah**" to denote occupation like taxi-wallah,
grocery-wallah.

Use of word **maane (Bengali) , Yani (Urdu) and matlab (Hindi/Urdu)** is
quite common "meaning" ("*What I mean is*...").

Use of **accha!** to express positive emotions as in "*Accha, so that's
your plan*" Or **chal** (Hindi for the verb "walk") to mean "Ok" like in
"*Chal, I gotta go now"*.

  

They have got so much incorporated in our day today life that we hardly
notice. Even you might find certain spelling unique in Indian English to
attract or just out of ignorance. I think this sign falls on the second
category. What is your pick?

But I personally think Indian English is much more globally understood
and acceptable than any other British colonies. And I strongly believe
we should not colorize our English; and do every effort to keep it close
to its root rather than making it pigeon language.
