Was looking for a simple instant coffee cake recipe and after reading
few here and there, zeroed on this one from
[Nestlé](http://www.tasterschoice.com/recipes/iced-coffee-bundt-cake/desserts/144734.aspx).
But as usual did not had many things at home and being a weekend decided
to go with what ever  had and make a simple sponge cake with coffee
flavor. Very surprised how simple and tasty it came out being a coffee
lover would try it again :) 

  

Had a disastrous start when mixed baking powder and baking soda in the
wet mix of butter and sugar. And at the end thought would put at-least
few raisins in the middle but that too I forgot as you see them in the
picture on the top layer.

  

But the best is when things goes right it goes RIGHT :) with all that
the cake came out very perfect I wish had a picture from just out of
oven , these are  pictures after cutting the cake. 

  

So here is my poor man recipe if you want to give a try.

  

  

-   2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
-   1 tablespoon baking powder
-   3/4 teaspoon baking soda

-   1 1/4 cups granulated sugar
-   3/4 cup unsalted butter
-   3 large eggs

    cool before mixing)
