On the 9th of April we were supposed to collect our new **Titre De
Sejour** (Long term VISA) from Cite Prefecture de Police. The interview
was fixed almost 3 months ago and we reached there before our scheduled
time to be make sure this time there is no big problem. But our turn
came around 4o'clock which is almost one hour behind our scheduled time.
And after checking all our paper she says oh! You need to pay 55 Euros
now as you got a new passport. Then the trouble started - so I went to
another counter to buy Notary Stamp for the same amount. But they only
take cash which I did not had enough at that moment. So after asking
them where is the nearest ATM I went out and on returning with
cash....?The main entrance was closed so I tried to persuade a lady
police to let me in as my wife, my passport every thing is inside and I
am stuck in this "no man land". She didn't understand anything or
doesn't wants to understand at all. But with repetitive appeal she
understood or got bored with me to let me in. But to my surprise ?
GOD!!! that counter got closed to give any Notary Stamp. So, trying to
behave properly and without loosing any temper I asked that lady on the
counter to get me some thing in written officially so that I do not
become an **refugee** in France for next few days till I get my new
visa. It again took some time and repeating the same problem she wrote
it on paper that I need to come back on Tuesday morning after the long
weekend of Easter. And best part was Pamela got her work done without
any problem.The problem is French people cann't think other than French
way and I sometime think they even don't know there are other way(s) to
the same which might be better than their way. Just to say - to cancel
your cell phone contract it takes two months after you send registered
letter with acknowledgement but, taking a new connection it only takes
an hour.Thankfully, no one asked for my passport during these past 3
days and I again had to wait for 2 hours in the same place for getting 9
month of Extension to stay in France.
