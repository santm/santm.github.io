There was a discussion in the running group to practice hill-run before
upcoming Hyderabad run which I am trying to be a regular member.
Normally the "numero uno" destination for hill training around Bangalore
is Nandi Hill ; which is 60KM north of the city. Have already run Nandi
hills few times and yes Nandi is grueling specially the last 3 KM. Nandi
run is 15KM in total where you go 7.5 KM up and come down the same. But
the run does not duplicate Hyderabad where we need to cross 3 flyovers.
Pipe-line road at south of Bangalore parallel to Kanakpura Road is very
similar to Hyderabad . The initial plan was to run 21 KM one way and had
a sumptuous breakfast at one farm house.

On the D-day morning the plan was little changed as decided to do 12.5KM
up and down to complete 25KM and then take our cars to the farm house
for breakfast. So we started running from KSIT Engineering College and
followed pipe-line road and crossed NICE-road, Ravishankar Guruji
Ashram, Angana, and reached APS Engineering collage where Pipe-line road
cross Kanakpura Road again. I turned back and completed my 25KM while
few went ahead and reached the farm house directly. Here is the
elevation graph from my new GARMIN :) I am very proud to say I did not
stopped the whole trail and was able to run all along and completed it
:) :)
