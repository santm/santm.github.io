It meant to be a vacation within vacation today. As we did not have to
catch any train neither any bus nor get up early for any fixed
destination. Relaxingly, we had our self-made breakfast and then headed
towards railway station for renting a cycle to bike. At first, we went
towards the city center of Interlaken where there is a big Casino and
park. From there we biked all the way towards the lake Brienz. Weather
was perfect although bit hot but being on lake side it was pleasant.
Major part along the lake was shady which was a big relief.

We took some time off at lake shore in shady place and listen to the
Indian classical instrumental on I-Pod which was really relaxing - the
sounds of water waves along with the serenity of the lake. Words are
lacking to describe how we felt. A perfect escape from the life we know,
a strange question was- why we need to go away so far from home to find
peace.

  
Anywayz, we came back to the hotel for a very late lunch and Santanu
wanted to take siesta. And you know, it suddenly started raining like
cats and dog; we felt how lucky we must be to enjoy yesterday at top of
Europe. It was raining sans cease even after 3hrs when we had to ride in
rain to return the bikes. Pff..... :( It just stopped after we returned
the same.
