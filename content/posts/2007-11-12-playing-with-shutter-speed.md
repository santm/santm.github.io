Love taking pictures with long shutter speed at night - technique is
very simple. All I needed was a tripod to secure camera from shaking
while leaving the camera shutter open. I know this is not a great
picture but that is what I got from my balcony. A better one with
Kharghar landmark [Utsav Chowk is posted
here](http://www.santm.com/gallery3/index.php/2008/kharghar/img_0077).
