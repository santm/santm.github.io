The temperature in Spain was quite hot compared to Paris. It was around
37° C when we reached Granada in the afternoon. The bus station for
intercity is not at the city center but there is a good connection of
public transport for the same. Our hotel was at the center - Plaza
Royal.

  

Around 5 PM, we headed out from hotel, it was still very hot and bright.
We walked towards Plaza Nueva. We entered into two churches while
walking along the Darro River. They were small churches compared to the
cathedral but also have nice wood work. Then we walked uphill towards St
Nicolas Church in **El Albaicín**

style="text-align: justify;">It is on hill top from where you can have a
great view of Alhambra at the sunset. The cobble stone roads are really
narrow. There are lots of tourists at that view point in the evening so
are gypsies. They were playing music and selling their art
works.</span>  
  

As we had time before the sunset we walked down a bit and went to
Sacromonte. There are gypsy caves most of which are now converted into
houses. But there is one part left for historic and touristy purpose.

  

Then we came back to The Church of San Nicolás. I am quite sure if you
been there recently you must be knowing Bill Clinton also re-visited
this place while he was President as he was here once as a young
student. Well even with out his historic visit this place at the sunset
is really great to look at the red fort – Alhambra.

  

This is one of the photos that were there in that Smart Card Media with
which we had problem. It would have been very sad if those photos were
not recovered.

  

Well I must admit this time the vegetarian place recommended by ***Rick
Steve*** was good for dinner.
