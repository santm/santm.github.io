Micro$oft is doing a round of business and technical launch show around
India. The products are Exchange 2007, Office 2007 and Vista. I attended
only a brief session @ Hyatt.

Well, somehow my name was not there even though I registered 10 days
before the event.

  

And my business card with orange and blue dots did not help much to get
attention from those desk people. Anyway, it was solid 40 minutes of
work for me – replied emails, chat with business contact got updates
from their team – thanks to CDMA mobile card. This picture of Mumbai’s
famous "dabbawalla" got my attention which is installed in the
down-stair lobby as an object of art.

  

Well lots of promises about security from Micro$oft, but I got bit scary
about the new “Office Groove 2007” as it seems it uses port 80 to
connect and update sharepoint server. I think I need to know more before
I make my final take. A new mantra was “blog” as speakers were
mentioning new search capabilities; and used internet and blog as two
different things. Sorry could not follow - does not blog stands for
“Web-Log” in short.

Well it is M$ at the end of the day – every time they promise – “We are
more OPEN with our new version of software so your heterogeneous network
components can work seamlessly.” But then they redefine new standard for
their implementation of “OPEN” standard. And people in the technological
world have to take two steps back with one step forward. Leave apart,
let’s not get into those details.

I might miss a good lunch to rush back to work. Goodies are welcome M$:
