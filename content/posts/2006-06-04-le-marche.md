<span style="text-align: justify;">The open markets in Paris have been
in existence since ages. It's here that you find freshly picked fruit
and vegetables, fresh fish from Brittany and Normandy, meat, flowers,
farmhouses cheeses, breads – you name it ... its there. Food controls
are very strict in France and be assured of their quality and
cleanliness of preparation. French understands the quality in life and
nothing demonstrates this better than the wonderful food markets in
Paris. It is very lively all together different adventure to
explore.</span>  

  

Parisians of all walks of life love to shop and browse among the
open-air stalls as merchants cheerfully trumpet - often with humor - the
quality of their goods. Rain or shine, the markets start early in the
morning and close around 1:30 p.m. So, its best to go early in the
morning as they do become crowded with Parisians doing their weekly
shopping.  
  

One at Boulogne we came to know recently after our 3 years stay at
Paris. Here, you get every thing in cheap price….and also fresh items
seems like just from garden. Freshness of the raw products itself
increases the appetite of one. Not only food items even beaded jewelries
to clothes, utensils to electronic kitchen wares are available. While
taking these photos I was asked from which journal I belong …..whether I
am from Pakistan, even one said for taking photos its 10 euros. So, it's
truly a delight to visit these markets, whether to wander the aisles and
savor the sights and smells, or to buy the veggies. You don't have to be
a gourmet cook or spend hours slaving over the stove, as many vendors
even sell fully prepared dishes, from Turkish food to rotisserie
(roasted chickens).
