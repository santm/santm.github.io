In recent time, there is no post in our blog.  Few days back, newspaper
mentioned popular blogs are drying as "**twitter or facebook**" becomes
popular ways to communicate with readers. Many bloggers started to
update about themselves in social-site or micro-blogging using SMS and
original blog surffers. For us nothing as such happened; we just got
super busy from busy.

We were very happy that my younger brother and his wife took the pain to
come over to Bangalore (10-13<sup>th</sup> July). Though it was just for
3 days out of their hectic one month annual India trip. Day they
returned to Calcutta they had flight in the night to California. It was
fun for very short span and I had classes whole week and even on
Saturday. Pamela took them around to Commercial street and Garuda Mall.
Was able to spend Sunday with them; we went to Richies at Frazer town.
Well this place is not a great if you are looking for ambience and
cleanliness. But the kebab are mouth watering and price is very
reasonable. We have been there twice already; each time we go there its
just for food and keep our eyes on plate only.

The day I dropped them at Airport ; reached office and realized my turn
is coming *to travel*. I will be going to **Singapore** for a week on
business trip(26-31<sup>st</sup>).

Now need to clear out all those tiny bits of to-do’s which had been
procastinated for a while. To top up this I am having classes every
Saturday @
[IIM.](http://www.santm.com/gallery3/index.php/2009/egmp "EGMP XIII pictures")
This mean more subjects, exams and more preparations.

At work things are really crazy at times now I can relate
**"Organizational Structure"** and **"Organizational Behaviour"**.  If
you are like me do not get puzzled by these terminology. Before
attending the B-school I didn't knew them either but had practised
through experience.  The first one deals with organization at large and
how it behaves through change at difficult or good times.  The second
one is focused on each individual and groups (formal and informal)
within the organization. No one can escape these at professional front
but knowing these theories is definite plus.
