Today went to the local BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) office
to get my property Tax receipt which I paid in June there. Was told to
go other one as this office is being closed. God only knows why
Government build office first and operate there for few years and move
to another one. On going to next office  

 The guy told without looking at me ***"Come Monday"***

  

Me - ** *"Sir Monday is Off due to Ganesha Festival"***

  

Him -  swallows  his words and says ***"OK come Tuesday"***

  

Me -  ***"Sir I need it today"***

  

Him - Now he looks up and says ***"come afternoon"***

  

Me -***"Sir it is already afternoon as it is 12:20 PM"***

  

Him - ***"OK get the bank statement"*** to prove the money is credited
as you paid by Cheque"

  

Me - little annoyed  -***"It is three months and I am telling you it is
debited from my account"***

  

Him - takes the acknowledgement slip and goes to a room and comes back
 in 5 seconds.

  

Me - Goes to the same room after 30 Sec; ask the lady with computer for
the receipt.

  

She hands me over the print outs.*(surprise surprise so this is the time
it really takes 1 minutes max) *

  

Me  asked for Official Seal

  

She points back to the first guy

  

Me  come back with the printouts he signs and puts the round seal.

  

Thanked him very politely. And got out of there.

  
The whole thing took only 10/15 minutes a max and my good luck that my
work was done. Best part he spoke in Kanada and I kept on replying in
English.  Whatever we do as Indian with watching MTV and eating McDonald
a visit to Government Office still  remains nightmare which I postpone
and procrastinate for ever. As those Officer or a Clark does not change
their attitude.
