Our trip to South  was one for which we hardly planned meticulously.
Moreover, my son got fractured elbow but then also our spirit was on
high although bit dampened that whether we will enjoy or not; kind of
excitement mixed with anxiety, hope and happiness. I still remember the
moment we sat in the car and started for the trip which was going to be
one of the longest drive with Aarush.

We  left Bangalore on 11<sup>th</sup> December 2010. As nothing much
planned we packed some fruits and snacks which could be of help in
desperate times and of course a camera to capture the moments.

Although the principle best followed in the case of accommodation is –
‘To each to his own’. In this trip no prior booking was done as we
didn’t knew which night where we will be. It was on-spot which Santanu
liked most. Well the trip was a great one on our Indica as we sold the
car within 3 weeks after returning to Bangalore. It was a sad separation
but too much hassle to keep her with change of registration and etc. And
now after almost two years all the travel-logs are now published.
