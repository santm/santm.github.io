[(....Continued...)](http://blog.santm.com/2009/05/little-tibet.html)
Next day we woke up leisurely had a wonderful breakfast . Our host
meticulously wrote down all the attractions near Madikeri. The list
included **Tala-Cauvery** – birth place of river Kaveri, **Raja seat**,
**Abby Falls**, **Omkareshwara Temple**, **Cauvery- Nisargadhama**. We
decided for all except the last one as we wanted to take it easy and not
rushing between attractions.

As soon as we started driving to **Madikeri** *(district headquarters of
**Coorg**)* the real beauty of Coorg started to unveil itself. The air
was clean - fresh but was bit chilled. The lush green hills with teak
trees and coffee plantation rejuvenated our eyes and mind. Coorg is in
on the western ghat of India and above 1500 m. This makes this place
cooler through out the year. Local call Madikeri the Scotland of the
east (*in* North East ***Shillong** is refereed as the Scotland of
India).*

There are numerous coffee plantation sizes various from few acres to
hundreds. With coffee there are other plantation like orange, pepper and
nutmeg in between.  Almost every plantation has one or more streams for
water - all these streams joins Cauvery. as they descent. But currently
the biggest challenges are labor as traditional labors are migrating to
urban areas for a better paying job and lifestyle.

Heading towards Tala-Cauveri passed Madikeri, it reassembled like small
hill town of North East with houses painted in bright colors perched on
hill. This  route leads to  Mangalore. Being a weekday there were not
many cars towards Tala-Cauvery. Tala Cauvery is around 40 KM from
Madikeri. On the way we took few stops to shoot pictures with clear blue
sky. Only few days back, there was a
[Marathon(44KM)](http://www.hindu.com/2008/11/29/stories/2008112952180300.htm "Coorg Marathon")
and road was marked with distances from the finish line. Last part of
the road was straight uphill climbs from Bhagamandala.  **Bhagamandala**
is supposed to be *sangam* of three rivers; **Cauvery** and the
**Kanika** are the real one, while third one is invisible *(mythical)*.
There is a temple but we did not stopped and continued to final
destination through winding roads.

There is a pond which signify the origin of Cauvery. Its situated on
slops of **Brahmagiri hills**. Every year during Makar Sankranti the
pond over flows with water and devotees collect them as holy  water.
There are
[steps](hhttp://www.santm.com/gallery3/index.php/2008/coorg/IMG_2388 "Steps to hill top")
which takes you to the peak and gives a bird eye view of the temple and
pond from there. I took [Aarush in
Kangaroo-sling](http://www.santm.com/gallery3/index.php/2008/coorg/IMG_2391 "Aarush and me ")
and he co-operated. It was very windy at the top which forced us to come
down quickly.

[![](../images/thumbnails/2009-06-05-madikeri-and-around-raja_seat.jpg)](../images/2009-06-05-madikeri-and-around-raja_seat.jpg)On
the way back, we had lunch at East End Hotel on the highway towards
Mysore next to petrol station. We ordered some rice and chicken
curry(kodava style). The ambiance is ordinary but crowded which means it
is a popular destination and safe place for dining.

  

After lunch we headed for Raja seat but somehow missed first time and
had to make an U-turn to comeback.  Former kings watched the sunsets
with their loved one from this place. The  curved road to Mangalore
under the valley adds magnificantly with  hills, green valleys, studded
with paddy fields in the background. There is a toy train which was not
running at that hour for kids and family.

From there we went to Omkareshwara Temple;  this is within  Madikeri
town.  It was built by the Lingarajendra II in 1820 in the combination
of Catholic, Keralite, Gothic and Islamic styles of Architecture. We
could not enter the temple as it was closed during the afternoon.

  

After that  we rushed to Abbey Falls this is going back towards Mysore
road and taking a left from the highway. In local language Abbey itself
means falls so a literal translation will be *falls falls.* This road is
winding and narrow and we need to keep on driving as Sun was dipping
quickly. This  falls is located within a private property but open to
public. Aarush too a quick short nap in this part. Soon roaring  water
woke him up. It was a delight to find plenty of water during dry months
of December. During the monsoon season from July to October it must be
flowing like a torrent. The view from the  hanging bridge is quite
enjoyable. The cascading water descends to the river Cauvery.

[![](../images/thumbnails/2009-06-05-madikeri-and-around-abbey_falls.jpg)](../images/2009-06-05-madikeri-and-around-abbey_falls.jpg)Headed
back to home-stay before it was complete dark. Next day morning we were
not sure what to do (as **Nagarhole** and **Dubare** will not be
enjoyable for Aarush) and ultimately decided to head back to Bangalore.
We came back to Mysore spent a good amount around the main market area
and Ramkrishna Mission. Around dusk we left Mysore so that we can reach
Bangalore bit late avoiding evening's rush traffic.

Bottom line is you can visit Coorg all year around if you love rain or
aviod  monsoon as it rains a lot in the western ghats. Getting out of
Bangalore is really difficult but leaving a place like this is very
painful after a nice trip.
