After finishing
[Belur-Halebid](http://blog.santm.com/2011/03/28/halebid-belurliving-with-past "Halebid-Belur")
by 3.00PM we moved towards Chikmaglur as we wanted to reach our
[Apna-Sapna](http://apnasapnaholidays.com/? "Apna Sapna") homestay
before dusk. For God knows what reason here all homestay are highly
priced based on per person per night. The Mountain section from
Chikmaglur to Attigundi (village) was excellent and fun to drive on the
twist and turn. The last part was a dirt road where we took diversion
for our homestay a downhill road. Almost reaching there we saw three
gates to enter three different coffee estates. Bit confused initially
but then figured out by guessing. Best part here you don’t get any
signal on your mobile other than BSNL (state owned provider).

On reaching there we were given welcome drink and then showed our room
by friendly staffs. It was not yet dusk and we freshened and sat in
their dinning deck area to watch sunset. Mean while Aarush became friend
with their in-house puppy. Although we were bit scared but he was fine
with him. Valley in front of dining deck gave great view of sunset and
sunrise.

There was another couple other than us who came to celebrate their
birthday. They were friendly we enjoyed their company that night. Aarush
dozed off early evening unusual then other days as he had lots of
activity for one afternoon. Next morning we woke up bit late and missed
the sun rise but enjoyed morning serenity. Only thing we encountered
here was butterflies and flock of birds chattering merrily. Around 10 we
all got ready for their estate trip to go down in their 4X4 jeep.

The first part of the estate trip was an introduction to different
type’s coffee and their processing. We saw how it is dried under sun and
tested the sweet coffee berries. We went to a roaring water fall within
the Estate, Aarush and Santanu had nice time under fall. There after we
waited for a while for our lunch. In meanwhile we came to know that all
estate managers who kept us in good company with small talks and jokes.
With chitchat we all became so friendly that hardly we felt that few
min. Before we were all strangers and how time went by…didn’t have any
track of time. They even arranged a rifle shooting for other guest to
celebrate his B’day.

Late evening we were dropped to our rooms back then after relaxing we
went for evening walk. We walked through other estate where we could
hear the music of the cascades that dot this scenic landscape. And then
finally found small stream of water gushing through their estates.Next
morning around 10 we started for our return journey to Bangalore
leisurely. On way back we paid 200 INR extra to traffic police for
taking one way route at Chikmaglur town.
