This is about my commute to work nowadays when weather is graceful with
me and I ride to work. I hope it can not be better than this. Crossing
the most green part *(there are loooooots of green bucks around as
well)* of PARIS on a bike.

  

I leave you to explore the rest from Google map. I am sure you will have
fun. If I compare this with people in Bay-Area (CA), New-York or
Bangalore, Delhi I think people will envy me.  
I need to elaborate more on the word **envy** and why I chose. As in
first version of this post I did not do that. If you have grown up with
**green devil with a tail** and a **broken TV** advertisement I am sure
you know what I am talking about.

  

YES! the famous ONIDA first advertisement that stirred Indian middle
class. Before that the advertisement agencies did not dared to cross any
taboo that could be controversial and backfire on them. Well, later
thanks to **Pooja Bedi** we Indian got some maturity in advertisement ;)

  

The ONIDA advertisement was simple; it was about a TV which was supposed
to be so good that neighbor throws a stone and breaks it due to sheer
amount of envy. So the message was to get some different idiot box then
your neighbors and show it off. At the end in Indian middle class every
body wanted to be different and lots of them got ONIDA which made them
all living in same kind of glass houses. To me it was as good as any
other mid-range TV for that price. But unfortunately those new proud
ONIDA owners found themselves that they can't tell each other over a cup
of tea that they got 30 channels in their new TV to watch DD1 (Indian
National TV Network). Well those are the stories of 80s but campaign of
ONIDA remains same till today. You can read more on the same and check
**[ONIDA](http://www.truthatonida.com/ "ONIDA")** latest advertisement
at their web site.

  

I am not sure who is envying whom - is it **me** who is **envying** at
others who passes me with whooping speed in their big fat German SUVs or
someone reading this finds it as a cool ride to work.**[

I tried my best to add this from Google maps. And of course there is the
big image with red line which represents my route. Check [Google
Maps](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=6+rue+godefroy+puteaux+france&ll=48.863529,2.283611&spn=0.042687,0.096045&om=0%3Cbr)
I will try to post some nice pictures along the route in few days.
