A few more week we will move from our current address; this time within
Bangalore.  So compared to last moves it is going to be a very small
one.  In 2003, we crossed Atlantic (California to Paris), in 2006 we
crossed Indian ocean (Paris to Mumbai) and in 2008 we moved within India
(Mumbai to Bangalore). Now this is just 20 Km move within Bangalore
city.

The painters from Asian Paint Home Solutions are doing the paint job and
they are supposed to finish by 25th November.  The color scheme is going
to be primarily white with little variant on one major wall. Hope all
things works out as planned.

We just had a wonderful week long break in Rajasthan during diwali;
Pamela is working on the  travelogue. We are posting the pictures as we
finish writing the details.
