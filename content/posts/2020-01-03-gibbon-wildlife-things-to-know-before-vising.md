Hollong - the state tree of Aaasm. The story goes back like this when
the British came and saw these long trees, they asked ***How Long?** And
it became **Hollong Tree.** Just like "**there is a brown crow**" was a
way to say "*<span

It is only 20 sq KM of Sanctuary. Actually, it is the oldest
miscellaneous plantation having Dipterocarpus and Mesua as dominant
species It was declared a Reserve by the British way back in 1881,(53
years after the advent of British rule) The original forests used to
extend to the foothills of the Patkai mountain range. Since then, the
forest has been cleared mainly for tea growing by the British. In the
1960s people from Majuli were settled here, so small villages have come
up also. Now it is a small tropical wet forest 20 sq km in size.  
  
The place is easily accessible and has 7 species of primates. Only walks
are allowed and Hollock Gibbon easily sighted. The area has Northeastern
India's only nocturnal primate – the slow loris But you have to be
overnight in Gibbon itself to see the slow loris. The accommodation is
basic inside Gibbon. (night visit is now banned) There is a presence of
pigtailed and stump-tailed macaque which can be sighted with moderate
luck. In winter (starting late October) it is good for forest birds
several species of forest butterflies and giant squirrel also can be
seen. The dense forest makes it difficult to see too many birds. Guides
claim that in the main road cutting through this small sanctuary more
than 100 species of butterflies can be identified in the months of Oct
and November as also in March-April. 

  

Though a plantation it looks like a natural forest with all stories of
canopy extant. It’s a natural-looking rain forest and surely worth a
visit. The sanctuary is now insular and has no connectivity with a
larger forest belt. But earlier it had contiguity with Disoi Valley
Reserved Forests(RF) Disoi RF, Tiru RF and Geleki RF bordering Nagaland
and was the natural abode of all these primates. Due to large scale
human-induced degradation especially from Nagaland the Gibbon Sanctuary
is what is left. A pocket herd of the elephant is largely resident in
this sanctuary and leopards are also found. Sighting of the groups of
primates requires prior arrangement with forest authorities. in this
unique forest, It is the best place for orienting a naturalist to the
representative rain forest habitat condition coupled with interesting
primate sighting especially the Hollock Gibbon which is the only ape
available in India. Photographers usually try their luck.

  

It does not take long to explore Gibbon usually people do it ex
Kaziranga they take a hired vehicle to go to Gibbon WLS and leave very
early 4 am so they reach the place 128 km (2 and half hours) and then
Gibbon activity is over they come back to visit Eastern Range in
Kaziranga on same day. The place is 30 odd minutes from Jorhat airport
and so on the last day of the tour, it is fruitful to visit this very
small sanctuary for those flying out via Jorhat airport. **Jorhat**
airport is 90 km away.
