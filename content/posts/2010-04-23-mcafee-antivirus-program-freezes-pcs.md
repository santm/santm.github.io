After starting my office laptop it goes for freeze within 5 minutes. I
was very worried what went wrong;   my current laptop is cranky and that
is why ordered a new one which was delivered yesterday. The  new laptop
is getting build by the IT Team as I write this post.  But i was worried
that I will lost all my data like a horror movie where every thing you
do goes wrong.   Any way after trying Ctrl+Del+Shift many times I just
pulled the power and removed the battery with a quick prayer. Well my
Outlook In-box was corrupted as a result but it was fixed post reboot
and I am back in action.  I saw a small pop-up about McAfee when it was
frozen but could not make out what went wrong. But then I saw this news
looks like I am not the only one who had this problem.

One thing for sure some how Microsoft delivered Winows-XP as robust
desktop platform compared to those Win'98 and win-2k and that is a
reason such small hitch are totally unexpected  as a end user.
