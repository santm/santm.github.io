A great gesture of being humble by Mr. David Thomson today.  He did
shook-hand  with the entire front row as we officially inaugurated of
our new Office today.    Luckily I  was there early bird :)  and was
touched by his firm handshake. He is the  wealthiest man personally saw
in person  he used to be ranked in top 10 richest man according Forbes
few years back.
