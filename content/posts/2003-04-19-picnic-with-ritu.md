It has been a long time we were exchanging e-mails and phone calls with
Ritu, but could not meet her in-person. She is a friend of Akiko's Paris
friend. A long chain; but a start to make social contacts in new place.
I am personally not that social to make friends at party or other social
gatherings that is one reason holding me to join local Expats club.Ritu
arranged a great picnic and was very nice to meet all other expaticians.
It was great day and we had lots of food and fun. It was a very
beautiful park in 19th arrondisement infact, place for newly wedded
couples to take their wedding pictures.
