Aarush having nice time in green patch of IIM Bangalore Campus. Color of
ball and his T-shirt coincidently matched and isn't that look nice on
green background? I took Pamela and Aarush to show them the southern
part of Bangalore which I am visiting quite often this year on academic
purpose. A great place to escape from routine life and bring back
memories of ... "***Purani Jeans Aur Guitar...***" days.
