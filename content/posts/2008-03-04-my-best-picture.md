Aarush has crossed 6 weeks mark now and till recent time there was no
picture of him with me. Well, there was no specific reason for the same.
Normally, when I leave for work he is sleeping and in the evening it is
dark and we are against using flash while taking pictures of Aarush.
That leave only weekend but recent weekends were very hectic and I was
away to Bangalore and the stories goes on...

So one fine morning just before leaving for work we had photo session;
and according to me it came out best - special thanks goes to Pamela for
capturing this magical moment. *Now I have to click some picture of Mama
and son* ;)
