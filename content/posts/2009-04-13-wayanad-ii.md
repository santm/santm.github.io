After a deep slumber the next morning we woke-up fresh and energetic.
Aarush wanted to play seeing an open space- courtyard. They have toys,
cycles, carom board, badminton court, balls to play with. He was really
happy to get all these stuffs. *What more parent wants if kid is happy
you are happy otherwise nothing on earth can make you happy*.

Morning, we were shown all rooms available there. It was a nice room
with a central common area and one room each on either side. Each room
can easily accommodate a family of 3 (2 adults, 1 kids)at main buiding
while bamboo room can accommodate 4 in each room. We opted for room at
main building.

The huge banana and green paddy plantation in front of the home-stay is
a wonderful delight to the eyes!! Then leisurely we freshened up and
gobbled down the breakfast prepared. Her breakfast area is an open space
with neat dining set, covered by a thatched roof with lovely breeze and
great view. Mean while Nash asked us what we wanted to do and suggested
what we can. He gave all route directions. Truly, I didn't wanted to do
much but more of relaxing.

We decided to go to **Thirunelly temple** and **Kuruvadweep**.
Thirunelli temple is nestled amidst three hills. The deity worshiped
here is Lord Krishna, but the place gained popularity for the Papanasini
river (rather a stream flowing beside the temple). Road to the temple
passes via **Mananthavady** town from Panamaram is hilly with bumpy
roads and green all around. You get to pass through fields and forest.
Picturesque for sure. We drove the road which connects **Wayand** with
**Coorg** and at the end we took a left turn(14 KM) for the temple. This
temple is a peaceful and serene place. *Since not properly restored I
won't recommend to visit.* It can be skipped unless just want to drive
or have some religious rites to perform.

Then from there we went to Kuruvadweep. Roads didn't improved much. As
the drive went on, different shades of green we could find all around
Wayanad. Nice treat to eyes; our eyes were relaxed seeing green all
around. Since we stay in concrete jungle for us it was really paradise.
The water was knee deep, muddy and not very clean as there were plenty
of plastics and junk from tourists and local shops - we did not felt
like crossing the same. If you have time you can take boat ride.

At evening owner, Mrs Seetha of the home-stay offered us with hot
coffee. Coffee and tea served are unlimited without charges and ensured
that we were served with hot sumptuous dinner once Aarush's dinner was
over. This was really nice of her .
