Last day, woke up very early in the morning to visit Candolim, Sinquerim
beach- Just to avoid scorching heat of sun. The shimmering sea stretches
to the horizon. Spent some time to savour the view then headed to Fort
Aguada. Fort Agauda crowns the rocky flattened headland at the end of
the beach. Constructed in 1612 to protect the northern shores of Mandovi
estuary from Dutch and Maratha raiders. It was a reference point for the
vessels coming from Europe at that time. This old Portuguese fort stands
on the beach south of Candolim, at the shore of the Mandovi river. Part
of fort is now turned to Taj holiday village and another part to prison.
Its worth a visit with superb view from top of the hill where four
storey Portuguese lighthouse looks down over vast expanse of sea sand
and palm trees. While descending the hill one can see River Nerul. Roads
of this part of Goa are really nice and scenic. Enjoyed the ride as
pillion rider. **Undoubtedly, it is the picturesque palm-fringed
beaches, scenic coves, sun-kissed sands and turquoise waters that make
Goa one of the world's premier holiday destinations.**

For lunch headed to another typical goan no-frill restaurant this time;
ordered for **chonok** and rice which was enough for two as portion was
big. Well recommended by guide book.

One more last time went to Baga beach to soak ourselves in turquoise
water. Enjoyed thoroughly and headed to hotel for pack-up as we were
leaving that night by bus from Mapusa; a new experience to travel with
sleeper coach night bus.

The sleeper bus was smooth at beginning but later along the way we had
two blowouts. Needless to say, we were late by 5 hours. Santanu was
forced to work from home next day.
