Today is the last day of our trip. We had already reserved for boarding
another panoramic train “Golden Express" which will take us to Lausanne
where we started our journey one week ago. By now I was so used to that
after waking up my first thing was to peer out the window to check
weather. And like every time it was bright sunny morning at our last day
of vacation. After having heavy breakfast we headed towards railway
station of Interlaken with our luggage.

From our previous experience with glacier express where we missed the
window seats we made sure that get the same while booking in
advance.This special train is broken into two main parts. In the first
part it is almost like any other Swiss railway train but it is only
written “Golden Pass” on the outside.And there are no special panoramic
windows; which is a blessing for the camera.

  

  
Traveling by train to Zweisimmen on the Golden Pass BSL train, offers
panoramic views of the Swiss Alps, mountain slopes and valleys with
picturesque chalets which is something different to experience. Train
snakes through the Simme Valley passing through the rural Simmertal
where one can see Swiss cows grazing on the Alpine meadows. Listening to
the distant sound of cowbells tickling on the pastures is very amusing.

At Zweisimmen, we changed to the Golden Pass MOB Train to Montreux. This
is the only line in Switzerland that offers VIP seat at the front of the
train giving a river's eye view. This ultra-modern train gives the
traveler the unique sensation of being totally at one with the grandeur
of the unfolding landscape. While passing through the region of
“Châteaux d'Oex” we saw beautiful Swiss villages for one more time.
There are lots of hiking or other outdoor activities around this region.
Admiring the view of Lake Geneva on one hand and the sprawling vineyards
alongside on other hand we descended to Montreux. We enjoyed magnificent
views of alpine beauty on our unforgettable rail journey of Switzerland.

  
We came to Montreux from Lausanne after keeping our luggage. We took a
relaxing promenade on lakeshore to go to Chateau de Chillon. This 13th
century castle has lots of history to tell in itself. Lord Byron's
famous poem “The Prisoner of Chillon” was set on prison which is at the
cellar of the castle. We spent almost 2 hours there and at the same time
it was raining heavily outside.

  
We wanted to go to Geneva to see “Jet d'eau” (water fountain) but it
looked like it might be a better idea to be at Montreux as we would be
running out of time. Later in the evening we boarded TGV back to Paris –
and this time it was in First Class: D
