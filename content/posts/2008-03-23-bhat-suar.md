Every time I visit my in-laws and see one of these **“Bhat Suar”**
(three-wheeler cart) on the road it brings back memories of my college
days. Durg(in-law’s place) and Bhopal(college day) were part of same
state 6 years back; although politically divided they are very similar
to an outsider like me on social and geographical terms.

First part of the name comes from the sound they make ***“Bhat-Bhat”***
and second part ***“suar which means pig”***. The design varies from
state to state and its mechanism is very simple and rigid for extreme
conditions. Maintenance is simple - all you need to open the hood and
fix it- no complicated electronics; only big mechanical parts.

Before coming to Bhopal I have never seen these big yellow tempos
(tutuk). Sometime they are the de-facto public transport in central
India. Since in these areas, public bus service is inadequate or nil and
a small auto for single person is expensive; They are very popular as
they are engineered to accommodate around 12-15 people. Memories of
these bones rattlers on uncomfortable pothole filled roads will remain
for long time. The conductor will always try to squeeze another
passenger chanting- **"Khasko bhai khasko"** (convince to make more
room). **"Ab kahaan khaskein"** ("Now, where do I shift?")would be the
apt reply.
