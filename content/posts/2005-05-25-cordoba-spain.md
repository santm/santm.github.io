When we started planning for **Andalusia** we did not thought of
**Cordoba** first. But later friends who had been there suggested
visiting Cordoba.

We walked from our hotel on the busy morning streets of Seville to reach
the train station. We bought ticket for AVE (fast train) to Cordoba. The
fair is not at all expensive compared to French standard as it costs
almost similar from Paris CDG airport to city center. The train service
is really good and train travels in high speed.

  

  

Cordoba’s main attraction is its **Mezquita**(Mosque). This is a living
history of Cordoba as it transforms from one culture and religion to
other. It was one of the first big city that was built by Moorish rulers
in Spain at 10th century. These leaders wanted to build a mosque for
their religion. Earlier the mosque was small but with time as Cordoba
prospered, it was extended to accommodate more people.

  

The double arch with red and white stripes makes a very immense effect
to the visitors. These double arches are purely for decorative purpose
but it is so unique. Later days when Christians gained their control
over Cordoba this was converted to a Church with very little
modification giving it a feeling of church inside the mosque.

The \`**Mihrab**\` traditionally had two functions in Islamic worship,
first it indicated the direction of Mecca (therefore prayer) and it also
amplified the words of the Imam, the prayer leader. But The Cordoba
Mosque Mihrab looks south in the same way as the Damascus mosque and not
south east in the direction of Mecca. This one is very beautifully
decorated with Islamic arts of gold on marble.

  

  

From there we went around various streets exploring beautiful patios of
Cordoba. Best time is early May to visit the same. There is a
competition for most beautiful patio in Cordoba, which means lots of
patios to check out in early May.

  

We had a light snack of fruits and juice near to Alcazar. The afternoon
was scorching hot. After waiting a good amount of time for the public
bus we took a taxi back to train station. The ride in the AC car was
worth (4 Euros) every penny as the outside was burning at 40 C.
