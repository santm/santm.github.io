This script you run on the source host from the same directory where all
those rrd files are there. I found this very helpful while migrating
between Linux and Solaris.  

  

    #/bin/csh

    set all_files=`echo *.rrd`
    echo $all_files
    foreach file ( $all_files )
    set base = `basename $file .rrd`
    /bin/rrdtool dump $file > /tmp/new1/$base.xml
    end

  

  
The do a \`tar\` with \`gzip\` as that will save lots of space and time
while transferring data between machines.  

  
And on the destination machine you uncompress and untar the file to an
empty directory.  

    #/bin/csh

    set all_files=`echo *.xml`
    echo $all_files
    foreach file ($all_files)
    set base = `basename $file .xml`
    /opt/local/bin/rrdtool restore $file /opt/local/htdocs/cacti/rra/$base.rrd
    end

  

  
  
Hope this helps.
