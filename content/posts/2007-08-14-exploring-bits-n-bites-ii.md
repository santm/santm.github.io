Continuing from my last post I like to share a great experience I had.
It was a sudden plan and I was tagged along with my instructor who
in-turn was invited by a local Singaporean colleague after work for
dinner. It was buffet for a fixed price at **Marina Bay Shopping Mall**.
The crowd was very young far-eastern or North-Asians. Sorry guys, I
could not figure out who is Chinese, Japanese, Koreans or just
Singaporeans…as they all looked alike and age-wise they looked like high
school or college students to me. Thankfully, our local guy made a
reservation otherwise we might had to wait in long queue.

I started with some sea foods; I tried **Oyster**r for the first time.
It was OK but did not found the delicacy as it is said in France - a key
component of **fruit-de-la-mer** (*fruits of the sea or sea food - in
this except shrimps and prawns rest all like oysters, clams, mussels,
whelks, and periwinkles come raw*). If I am not wrong the concept is
same in Kerala (south-most state in India) where any fish is treated
almost the same. Being a Bong- I am a lover of**fresh river fish**.

  

In the second round, I opted for Japanese **sushi and sashimi** which I
love and can have a lot. For many, it is raw fish (actually firm but
melt-in-your-mouth when you bite it). To me it tastes delicious when
dipped in Shoyu (Soya sauce), speck of Wasabi (very strong, hot
flavoured green mustard) and with gari (thin-sliced sweet pickeled
ginger). Ocassionally at end it is accompanied by **sake**-japanese
liquor.

While I was enjoying the same my colleague’s girlfriend had **turtle
skin soup**. It seems that it is very good for female skin according to
Chinese belief. Well well… all big cats of Asia are almost extinct due
to high demand from such Chinese myth. But I kept my WWF conservation
“fundas” with me while my colleague enjoyed fish-head which has same
realm of myth.

  

To conclude, I think I beat every one when it comes to **desserts**
which were really yum. Unfortunately, I did not had enough room left for
ice-creams which they had so many varieties to choose from. But, indeed
it was a great dinner.
