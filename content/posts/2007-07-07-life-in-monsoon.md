After scorching heat, monsoon has arrived in Mumbai. From last two
consecutive weeks particularly weekends (June 23-24 & June 30-July 1)
there were disruption of normal life due to heavy shower. Thank God,
those were weekends otherwise life of 20 million people would have
affected some way or other as many schools and offices are closed. We
stayed mostly inside and [I only ventured
out](http://blog.santm.com/2007/06/26/rainy-sunday/) twice to nearby
shops to get some grocery done for forthcoming week.

Almost all modes of transports were affected severely; local trains
which symbolizes life-line of Mumbai were stopped. People flying in and
out of Mumbai also had great difficulties. But with all that Mumbai was
back to business on Monday. This city and its people are doing quite
normal but as a first timer to the monsoon we are taking things with
surprise. Monsoon of Western India are well known to us as we were
taught with importance in our Geography classes about them and how they
effect the livelihood of farmers of this sub-continent.

These pictures were taken by one of our Support Engineer at
[Worli](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Mumbai,+Maharashtra,+India&ie=UTF8&ll=18.99611,72.823906&spn=0.017936,0.026522&z=15&om=1).
Due to heavy rain there were around 2000 customers of MTNL (State owned
Telco) were effected. One out of those 2000 customers was ours (a big
fat multinational bank) whose services were compromised for a week.
Counterparts sitting in developed countries don’t understand why it
takes seven days to get a link fixed during monsoon. Basically, they
don’t have idea of what **monsoon** is?

I am sure people would appreciate this hard effort put by telephone
line-men they had to pump out water from the trench before fixing this
mess. Red salute to all those people who get Mumbai going through tough
time like this.
