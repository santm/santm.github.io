It all started around very early 2002. After few correspondences between
our parents I was asked to come to India in April. After doing some
travelling around, on very last day I met Pamela in-person at Bombay on
27th April. It did not took much time for deciding about the biggest
step of our life.After phone calls and emails for next six months, we
got married on 8th November at Calcutta.I reached Siliguri on 5th
November whereas Pamela reached Calcutta at 30th October from Durg. I
with few of my family members reached Calcutta on 8th morning by an
overnight train journey. The main function was at night, which started
around late evening and ended at 2AM.Next day, evening we started again
for Siliguri from Calcutta. There was reception at Siliguri on 11th. We
started for Durg on 14th to attend another reception there. It was for
all those who could not attend Wedding reception at Calcutta. We started
from Durg again on 15th for Siliguri via Calcutta.Yes!! We did travelled
a lot on Indian Railways that time. On the way to Durg, Pamela applied
for her US visa at Calcutta on 15th. And finally on 23rd we started for
California.
