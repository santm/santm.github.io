Going to opera for the first time was a very eye-opening experience. It
was really fabulous and all the thanks goes to Francois for the same. He
gave us the recording in CD and printed storyline before. That really
helped us to enjoy and understand the musical drama. We went to the
Opera Garnier the old one in Paris. He got us one of the best seats in
the beautiful opera house as the TV camera was in our next box. We got a
very good view and sound. Although, the tickets were the most expensive
one but for the same price you might not get the best unless you know
the floor plan well. The architecture of this building is really very
beautiful and it is so decorative that it is very hard to explain in my
words. The break rooms for refreshments were so nicely designed and that
too with appropriate themes. The staging was very modern of Handle's one
of the best work ALCINA. If you get opportunity to experience this form
of art and music please do so. Now looking forward to visit to Opera
Bastille (the modern one) sometime soon with Francois.
