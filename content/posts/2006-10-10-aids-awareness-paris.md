Can any one guess what this publicity is about? Well, this is 2006 anti
Aids campaign by city hall of Paris ***(Paris protège l'amour means
Paris protects love)***

  

In the photo what we see is sunset on some historical building with moon
at backdrop, but when you take a close look moon is... a condom. It aims
at promoting the use of condoms among the population i.e., to have safe
sex. Personally, I believe it's neither obscene or vulgar rather a nice
way to make people aware.

  

Reason for writing a post on this matter is in my country such publicity
is really unthinkable where 5.7 million people are infected. Although,
India had edged in front of South Africa to become the country with the
largest number of people carrying HIV virus. People will start agitating
if they find publicity of this kind in any public places considering it
to be vulgar………….as it is still a matter of taboo where its not
discussed openly among the people.

  

Not only this, leave apart poor sections, sex-workers or uneducated
people but think of those trendy city young men and women drawing on
cigarettes and sipping cocktails. They are part of cosmopolitan elite
group upwardly mobile and well-informed. This section of Indians who are
more open to talk about AIDS - but when matter comes to them they never
think of applying the same to themselves…..so strange.

  

Hope one day….India is open enough to talk freely on this line.
