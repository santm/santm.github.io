Looking at Ballard Pier at south Bombay from my office window. **Bombay
port** is one of the busiest port in India if not the most. I am sure
looking at the picture you can figure out it is a old picture as the
weather is still gloomy with dark clouds here. It is one of the very
first pictures from our Canon G7 camera. I really like the way light and
shadow on the tree brunch, it is quite well center balanced shoot to me.

Naah….this is a not a post on my office window nor on camera just wanted
to find an short escape from gruelling work for few minutes and update
you all. Best part is **Pamela** has work hard to gain aesthetic
(appearances), ergonomics (actual human usage) and accessibility in our
blog. She tried to **categorize** each post; big **kudos** to her - look
out on the sidebar.

I would be going to **Bangalore** next week for three days on official
trip; it is almost certain that we have to move to Bangalore but that
should happen next year. Anyways, in meantime I will try to meet
relatives and friends at b’glore but that depends on their calender as
well. Till next…bonne weekend!!!
