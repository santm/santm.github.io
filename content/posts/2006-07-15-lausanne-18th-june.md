Alors , trip started on Sunday morning 18th for Lausanne from Paris with
out any plan for next 7-8 days to be done in Swiss. On Friday and
Saturday we made few calls to our friends to get an idea about the top
attractions in the Switzerland. Santanu got some print out from work
**MySwitzerland.com** about Post Bus.  
  
He reluctantly noted one hotel address for Interlaken and booked one B&B
for Sunday night around Lausanne. The train journey from Paris was not
much event full as Santanu slept most of the time and I enjoyed the
French country side while listening to music. Thanks to Santanu for
getting the I-Pod while he was snoring mildly.

On getting down at railway station we got all the information about top
sights to be visited in Lausanne from very helpful tourist office but as
it was Sunday the main Railway information center was closed so we could
not plan anything for next day. Lausanne being a small city by northern
part of Lake Geneva, home of Olympic Museum and Swiss court of Justice.

  
We spent that whole afternoon walking up and down its walkway. Starting
our walk along the lake side from Olympic park to Ch√¢teau d'Ouchy. From
there we went to Gothic Cathedral via central market after visiting
Esplanade de Montbenon. It was bit long walk ascending all the time to
the hill top.

  

  
While descending we realized the B&B that we booked was very far so we
asked about hotels in tourist office and they found us some thing nice
close to Olympic museum. After having bath we just walked along the lake
shore which was very pleasant & relaxing. But the nice evening walk was
very short lived as Santanu realized he does not have his wallet with
him for which we had to make a sudden U-turn and walk fast back to
hotel. Thank God it was such a relief to find it lying on the bed. We
ended up having dinner in nearby lakeside restaurant.
