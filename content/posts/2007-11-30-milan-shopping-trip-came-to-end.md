Time to say **Ciao, a presto** (bye, see u soon) to Venice!!! Although
we knew it might never be soon again. With a happy mood, we left for
Milan from where we started our memorable journey. We boarded Euro-star
for which we had to make an advance reservation. Indisputably it was the
best train we boarded in last seven days. On reaching Milan kept our
luggage in lock room and set off to explore the business city as well
fashion center of Italy.

  

  
Starting with **Milan’s cathedra**l, the city’s centerpiece and the
third-largest church in Europe is worth visiting. Next to Cathedral
Square “**Galleria Vittorio Emanuele**” – Milan’s great four-story-high,
glass-domed arcade- a place to shop for rich and famous. Milan’s famous
opera house was closed for renovation. We skipped Leonardo’s
“Last-supper” and his bronze horse which he never built.

  

We had pasta at lunch in a small store which was really ambrosial - no
doubt. Late afternoon, wandered through big brand stores for clothes and
ultimately I bought one wristwatch for myself as a souvenir which cost
me, dear.

  
  

  

  

  

Early evening, we headed towards a restaurant recommended by guide book
in the business district which was very deserted being Sunday.
Unexpectedly, we found the place and it was a big restaurant with white
table cloths. We were received with great affection and hospitality by
owners which we can never forget. The service was excellent along with
food. We started with Pasta and had fish as second serving oh! That was
big fish as they served us; Pamela missed all those bones and head as
they took away that trolley (as she is a big human-cat who loves to chew
bones be it fish or chicken). Well, slowly clock was ticking off giving
us a reminder to say Ciao to Italy. Train to Paris came from Venice and
we had a good night sleep after a long strenuous day.
