While browsing through web sites for summer travel deals I found there
was a very attractive deal by Ryan Air to Stockholm.We went there middle
of August when Paris was burning with summer heat. It was a great escape
to Scandinavia. Stockholm was very clean and very beautiful. Although,
the weather was not at its best as it rained for first two days.  
  
We stayed in the centre of Stockholm (Drottninggatan) one side of this
pedestrian street with full of shops.Our first day, highlight was Old
town of Gamla Stan, Skansen and Vasa museum. We walked all day and it
was a great way to get feel of Stockholm.  
  
Second day we spent most of the time on boat seeing archipelago; it is
very unique to see all those tiny islands so near by and ended with bit
shopping for Sweden glass work at City center. All these glassworks are
so nice but expensive too I wish, I had more money for them.  
  
Third day the weather was all clear with very blue sky. We visited Mills
garden and around - it was great!
