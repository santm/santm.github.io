As you know the growth of mobile is one of BIG discussion point of any
technology seminar or talk show you attend today. Everybody already
predicting more and more people will use mobile to access
internet/information/e-commerce compared to traditional desktop or
laptop. And in a country like India there will be lots of users who will
be "on-line" for the first time  and they will directly use a smart
phone bypassing key-board and mice altogether, in numbers they might be
larger than some European country.

  

Till date good mobile  phones used to cost an arm & leg. And if you like
Apple it still does in India as we have to buy the device upfront. But
 things are changing and changing fast. Starting with Moto-G we are now
seeing great phones (only androids) coming to Indian market for $15K INR
( $250) . And now with Asus, Xiaomi coming it looks every one is going
to feel the pinch where people are very sensitive to price  but looks
for best ROI. News channel reported [Asus sold 40K ZenPhone phone in 4
days](http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/asus-sells-over-40000-zenfone-units-in-india-within-4-days-227467.html).

  

It may be a great time for on-line retailers like Amazon, Myntra,
Flipkart who are seeing high  growth in this country. I am sure the
outcome  will be unknown may be at last we will have more non-cash
transaction in India.  Any one having the crystal ball Still I recollect
those hotted discussion had with my friends  about 1Mp and 2 MP digital
camera and we never though companies like Kodak will be out of business
 today and we will have 20MP camera in our phone.

  

Any company needs to have offering in HTML5 or native android to achieve
significant market share of new and upcoming mobile users in these part
of Asia. I know iPhone5 sold 20% more than the last one but the number
we are taking here is huge. And HTML5 and hybrid model is better as
every Android has different screen size.
