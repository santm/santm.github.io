With the cold weather and shorter day lights lots of baking is going on
and enjoying the butter and sugar lately. Feeling guilty as cann't
resist and moreover did not do any exercise after my Paris - Versailles
marathon :(

We were invited to one of my colleague’s place for the first time after
almost 3 years in France for ‘**Galette des rois**’. It was very
memorable and an enjoyable evening. Its a French custom to end the
holiday session; where there is something hidden in the galette and if
that is in your part you are considered king for that day. Children try
to find the same in their part and some time they endup doing
archaeological digging.

Pamela baked recently lots of cake and they came out good. The latest
one was this apple tart. This was awesome. Now, she really set a very
high mark for her skills and hope that she keeps it up :D
