Oh! summer, it reached 40 degree cel. or 100+ F this week at Paris.The
global pollution is taking its effect may be? 20 years back it used to
snow a lot in Paris but now it does not snow any more. The houses,
metro's are not designed for this kind of hot weather which makes it
more unbearable. We are surviving with Pedestal Fan but it is still far
from a rain. The heat wave is going to be there for another 10 days
atleast from now. Not only this, here power failure is also there.We too
faced the same, one fine evening it went off around 9.30pm & came back
at morning 2.30am.
