I have a fascination for the colour of autumn, mat be the reason is I
never experienced them before while in India and California. You can
enjoy the same in Paris where trees along the big boulevards changes it
colour. Around Paris particularly the Bois de Boulogne is very nice that
time. We went to Versailles just to take pictures. It was not a very
sunny day that Sunday, sun was playing around clouds. But it was nice
for a Sunday afternoon.
