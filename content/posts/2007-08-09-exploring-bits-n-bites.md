**Singapore** has so many **ethnic cuisines** to offer for its natives
that you have to stay long to explore all the corners. Food is highly
influenced by *Malaysian, Chinese, Indonesian and none other but South
Indian* too. Even annually Singapore government organizes **“Singapore
Food Festival”** in month of July. I was lucky enough to get a glimpse
of it. When it is a matter of food I consider myself to be “**not a
typical desi**” sticking only to one variety of food. I love to explore
as much as I can. But of course at same time I try to avoid certain meat
other then duck, chicken, turkey,lamb or goat. So, after that only
sausages or bacons can make way to my plate with choice rest I do not
like to taste due to various personal reasons. Well, please *do not be
surprised as I went very specific with meat*. As, according to French
there are so many delicious delicacies to taste ; that do not think only
about Chinese or Korean if you are a vegetarian.

Recently, I had **Red chilli chicken** from a western wok at my lunch.
For lunch, we have a food court opposite to our Singapore office. It is
not specific to any company; it seems there are few others nearby as
well. Variation ranges from *Indian to Japanese to even cross-cultural
fusion*. So a lot to choose from if you can figure out. I am not sure
sometime what they have as main-ingredients. But this dish was simple to
order as it said red chili chicken with rice. But, astonishing part was
the numbers of chilies it had. At first, I was bit skeptical about its
spiciness with so many chillies in plate but later I took a bite of one
of those and found they are not as hot as they looked. A Good experience
indeed:D.

The second picture of **Fish curry** is from a food court eatery; the
curry was excellent… very close to Indian kind but then the down hill
journey started for me. They said - you can choose two veggies as side
dish and I opted for Spinach and peanut sauce. I specifically asked
about the Peanut one as they mentioned it will be melange of sweet and
sour savour. When I was ordering my plate it looked like that sauce had
some sprouts but thank god I am not a vegetarian - infact it had some
dry fish. But, as a whole this side-dish was a big thumbs down which
changed my taste-buds …yuck!!! :.(
