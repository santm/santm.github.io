Just upgraded to the latest beta trunk of wordpress 2.2(bleeding) and
found myself with unrecoverable errors. Realized wordpress incorporated
tagging within the core but the old faithful Ultimate Tag Warrior does
not work any more :(  
Found another bug-hunt has started and hope for tag import from (UTW)
till then …… have to live with out tags Sigh!
