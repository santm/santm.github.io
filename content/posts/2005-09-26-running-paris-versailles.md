<span style="text-align: justify;">Almost after one and half year I was
running in any event. The weather was very grey but it was very pleasant
for running. Temperature was around 16 degree Celsius. The race was 17KM
long starting from bottom of Eiffel Tower to Ch√¢teau de
Versailles.</span>  

  
For the first time, Pamela accompanied me to the starting point of the
course so as to take a photo of mine with Eiffel Tower. The first part
of the run was along River Seine and then it goes to Forest of Meudon;
this was the most crucial part as it has a steep climb (approx.2kms).

  
Well, the water stops were quite nicely spaced and I did not felt like a
trash any time during the whole course. There were around seventeen
thousands people in total but at a time only 350 runners departs so when
I started it was almost 30 minutes after the first group started.Anyway,
the route was quite scenic as the main part was bit away from the city
in the forest & I finished by 1h 29mn 59s which is not that bad :D
