Well why I am writing this post -- I am stuck in a business trip and
missing her and Aarush for last 3 weeks. Sometime I wish I just could
dump my current job and spend some quality time with Family. But with
Financial commitment I donâ€™t think I can do that soon :(.

Any ways wish Pamela on her special day!!
