Sweet potato dessert (Ranga Alur Puli) is an age old Bengali dessert - a
sweet lover's delight for sure. *Its crispy outer layer mesmerizes
gastronomic senses*. As for its availability, it is more of a
traditional sweet, prepared in households. These days some sweet shops
are starting to include this in their repertoire to cater to the
time-constrained generation.

  

My hubby being born with a sweet tooth, do enjoy sweet of any kind. So,
this recipe is actually initiated and arranged by my **mom-in-law** for
him while I prepared it under her guidance on our short stay at Siliguri
this year.

  

**Ingredients:**  

-   Sweet potatoes: 500 gms
-   Flour: 1 ½ tablespoons if preparing stuffed one (otherwise 100gm for
    plain one)

<!-- -->

-   Milk: ½ litre
-   Sugar: 1 tablespoon
-   Coconut: ½ (grated)
-   Cardamom (green): 2-3
-   Raisins

<!-- -->

-   Sugar: 1 cup
-   Water: 1 cup
-   Oil for frying

**Method:The Puli Dough:**  

Wash and boil the s.potatoes until soft. Peel and mash. Add the flour
and knead into dough. Keep aside.

*The Stuffing: (optional)*  

Bring the milk to a boil by adding a tablespoon of sugar in it. When the
milk starts to thicken, add the coconut and the raisins and condense it
to a thick, sticky consistency. Remove from heat and add crushed
cardamoms. Let it cool.

**The Syrup:**  

Add a cup of sugar to a cup of water and bring this to a boil. The syrup
should be of medium consistency. Let it cool.

  

**Making the pulis:**  

Take a small portion of the dough in your hands and shape them
accordingly unless it is stuffed. If preparing stuffed pulis then
flatten the dough and make a cavity in the centre and fill it with a
little of the above stuffing. Seal the edges of the dough and give it
the shape of a puli. Heat oil in a wok and deep fry the pulis in
batches. Remove from oil as pulis start browning or golden. And dip the
pulis into the syrup carefully, one by one. Serve hot or cold.

  

**Frying Pullis:** We prepared **plain puli without stuffing** but
stuffed one are really mouth-watering and delicious….no doubt! Actually,
*Ranga alur puli (fried sweet potato dessert) along with other pulis
like Muger puli (made of moong dal or yellow moong lentil), Chirer Puli
(made of poha -beaten rice), chana dal puli, Chaler puli (made of rice)*
use the harvest produce—rice, coconut, date palm juice and jaggery etc
speciality items of **Shankranti**.
