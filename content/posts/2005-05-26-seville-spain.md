***Last day at Seville...*** After checking out from the hotel we took a
bus and got down next to the Casino of Exposition. But today it is a
public holiday at Seville which we did not knew, so the roads were quite
empty at 9 in the morning. After getting down from the bus we walked
towards Plaza de Espana. Plaza de Espana was built for 1929 world expo.
Lots of Latin American countries joined that expo. The world expo was
not a success as that year was marked as first financial disaster of the
Great Depression as U.S. securities lost $26 billion.

The famous tile work of Andalusia is at its best here. There are maps of
Spain from that time; the benches, the small decorative bridges are
really beautiful. We walked along the great corridors of Spanish
Pavilion. From there we walked to Alcazar while we saw the university
and the famous 5star hotel. The university used to be a cigarette
factory before.

King Pedro Castile in the 1360's with his mistress Maria de Padilla,
lived in and ruled from the Alcazar. Pedro embarked upon a complete
rebuilding of the palace, employing workmen from Granada and utilising
fragments of earlier Moorish buildings in Seville, Cordoba and Valencia.
The comparison between Alhambra is like comparing apple and orange. This
is build with lot of confusing room. The outside garden is really
beautiful which worth a stroll.

As that day was religious holiday with procession and big gathering of
people around the cathedral. We walked along the cathedral towards city
hall and further. After lunch we rested inside a caf√© for 2 hours to
beat the scorching heat.

We took a bus to visit Basilic of Macarena, the weeping Mary which is
world famous. We walked back all the way from there to Plaza de Espana.
It is better to visit west facing Plaza de Espana in the evening for
photos.

After all that walking we were really tired and exhausted. We had tapas
again for dinner next to our hotel. It was a better place with street
side seating. We really enjoyed my food with cool breeze and watching
people on the street.

Taxi ride to the bus stop for Lisbon was a good choice at late night.
But waiting for the midnight bus was not fun. But the overnight bus ride
was not bad.
