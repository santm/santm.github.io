Some update from [previous
post](http://blog.santm.com/2010/05/09/whats-happening) . Till far we
made numerous trip on weekdays and weekends. We are almost done as far
as carpenter work and civil work is concerned. There are still few
things pending but we can wait for now. The next major one and obvious
ones are **hardware and shower enclosure** fixing at bathrooms along
with **painting and electrical fittings**. We need to make all the
necessary holes for pictures and wall hanging before final painting
work. Hope to complete religious house warming (griha pravesh) in July
and wait till year end for final move.
