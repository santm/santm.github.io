After all these months, I prefer not to use years yet :) I started
formal French class. I am not sure how it will end up as it keeps me
reminding about my Spanish class which I dropped out after 2 months. But
for those 2 months I went on time to Foothill community college every
morning at 8AM. It was different as medium of instruction was English
now everything is French. It is not difficult to understand what the
teacher is saying but it is very hard to form a full sentence correctly
in french.

I applied for beginner (level I) but after writing the test last week I
found myself at level II yesterday evening. This must be due to my wife
who made sure I do well in this test. May be I should not have answered
so much as a beginner but I did not want to miss this chance as this
class starts twice a year only. I would like to thank Daniel (my office
teacher) as well. May be I could have learned better at first place
paying more attention to him and secondly if those (office) classes were
at regular interval.

I have to admit the class looks good with the dynamic and hard working
teacher. She looks like going to make sure her students learn to speak
and write proper French. The most of the students are from Asian origins
female who are working as house maid in Paris.

Well I need to memorize a list of verbs and their conjugation now for
tomorrowâ€™s test.
