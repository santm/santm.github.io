 <span style="text-align: justify;">It is no secret that I am a big fan
of IKEA's clean cut design. And now every time I  go outside of India 
try  to pick something from there. Wished  we got the whole modular
kitchen, beds, chest of drawers, leather sofa while moving back from
Paris. This time I visited IKEA store was next to Newark Airport(EWR,
NJ) and picked some small stuff for Aarush. When a neighbour looked at
the "Made in India" level asked from which store we picked up?  We were
shocked twice first that person did not knew about IKEA , and secondly  
wondered  what a journey this plastic item had across the world before
coming to our apartment.</span>
