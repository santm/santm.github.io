[Gallery 3](http://gallery.menalto.com/gallery_3.0_alpha_4_released) is
going to a big change from current gallery 2 and initial alpha release
did not have any migration path from gallery2. It was pushed to Beta
release after 2 alpha releases. but to my surprise I found it was
implemented in alpha 4 and here is the test result of a new neat code. I
am really liking the new compact code making gallery 3 faster and lean
compared to its predecessor. Similar, to
[WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org) new theme development is easy no
more smarty - thank God I never really mastered those PERL look alike.
Now it is simple PHP and CSS. Another core feature is Akismet which does
a fantastic job of filtering spam comments. I was able to import 3000+
images in 200+ albums without any problem. There are few things which
needs to be ironed before I can put the same in
[production](http://www.santm.com/gallery3/).
