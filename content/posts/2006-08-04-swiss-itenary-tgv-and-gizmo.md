Friday, thinking to write something for my blog ;) I think I should have
kept a track of my Friday bloging or changes I made on Friday :D. Well,
this post is not going to be about Friday but it is about our
Switzerland itinerary, experience with TGV etc.

  
Might have noticed there are lots of posts by Pamela in recent time –
wish she would have done before from our other trips also. It is GREAT
that she is so active on this now a days.

  
Firstly, a PDF map pointing all the places we been in Switzerland.
Thanks to *Pamela* again for her idea.

Secondly, while traveling for more then 3 days we carry Laptop - it
serves to down-load the pictures as cards get full within 1-2
consecutive days of visit. While coming back to Paris via TGV one of the
fastest train of Europe I found in the first class they have AC 220V
power socket to connect laptop.It helps in doing pending work or seeing
photos like us or watch film on DVD without being worried on recharging
battery. It was great as my current laptop battery does not last more
than 15-20 minutes. So here is the picture while Pamela down-loading
photos from card.

Photos from Golden-Pass train which we took that morning. In the 1st
compartment of TGV another difference is seat size with enough leg room
as they only have 3 seats per row compared to 4 in 2nd class.

Lastly, though I like to have all the latest and the greatest gizmo but
normally I run quite behind in reality compared to others. The biggest
reason is of course **financial** and other is it cost a lot in Europe
with the ugly VAT system.

  
My laptop is an old Pentium-III, digital camera is a 3 mega pixel, my
mobile phone is 4 years old. Hmm....for mobile phone although is not
really true as I lost the new one within 4 months of use.

So here are my next gizmo lists

  
I hope to upgrade my camera to a new [Panasonic LUMIX
DMC-LX2](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0607/06071904panasoniclx2.asp) as
soon as it is released and gets real good review from other users, not
those blur image its current sibling has. I hope to carry it all the
time compared to my current bulky one.

  
Get an [Apple MacBook in black](http://www.apple.com/mac/) when apple
removes the current $200 premium – hope apple does that soon and before
X-mas.

  
A cell phone that can sync with I-Sync and Outlook something from Sony
Ericson k750 which has all that but no rush let the price drop.
