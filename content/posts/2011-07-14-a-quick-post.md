Reading old newspaper clipping fascinate me; an article which earns a
good amount space on that day and most likely people read and forgot.
and here I am reading it after days with a fresh eye. And most times it
turns out to be a great story to read with eagerness.

This one was bit special which caught my eyes today was "[Chaturanan
Mishra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaturanan_Mishra "C Mishra")
passed away"; now there are few things which made me to write this quick
post. First the surname which is very similar of mine, but the name is
really catcher. I am quite sure no parent of 21st century is going to
keep this name for their boys due to many reasons.

The real meaning of this name is a person with four face and that is
Brahma the creator of universe.

It should not be confused with "Chatur" a quick English translation will
be a "Smart person" but somehow over years the base word "chatur" is
used with dark side of smartness like mischievous act which may result
in trap for not so "chatur" person. The last reason is off course if you
seen the blockbuster movie from Amir khan - "[3
Idiots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Idiots "3 - Idiots")" the memory
it bring back is enough to skip this name as there zillions of name to
choose from.

A humble tribute to Chaturanan Misra -- he was a freedom fighter from
Bihar's Madhuvan ; was imprisoned by British. Post independence he
served in both state and national legislatives and worked for
agriculture reform and farmers. Madhuvan northern part of Bihar is
famous for it natural color painting withÂ unique style. Some considers
Mathali ( the local dialect) as a very soft and poetic .
