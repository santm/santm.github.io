of this trip to meet his school and college mates as most of them are
working in Bangalore IT sector. Jeet plays guitar and mouth organ as
hobbies. His musical talent is in his gene , he got it from his
[mother](http://aarush.santm.com/gallery3/index.php/1styear_001/Fifth-month/IMG_1570)
who is a trained singer and used to perform in All India Radio in her
young days.

Well enough of introduction -- this was a very informal recording as we
noticed Aarush was enjoying his first live music. Normally he turns his
head towards speaker when we play some music to locate the source of
sounds. But nothing comes close to a live performance a little one also
realizes the same :D.
