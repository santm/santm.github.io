Visiting the northern part of Karnataka for its historic and artistic
monuments were long due. We thought of doing it two years back during
15th August long weekend but postponed the same due to late rain and
high water level at Tungabhadra Rivers. This year we started to plan
early and consulted two avid travelers and their guidance in setting up
the itinerary. It was planned that we would use the 2 weeks school
vacation for this trip, but then I personally felt it would be a great
miss Durga pooja twice in a row. So we modified our itinerary again and
split the same in two with 5/6 days of stay in Bangalore to celebrate
Durga Pooja.  
  
On the negative side it resulted in longer drive for me and dropping few
destinations from Northern sea-side destinations. Now we have to do that
another time as it would require another sojourn of a week to complete.
Here is both the list for a easy reference.
