In India retail sector is growing like mushrooms especially in metro
suburbs. Everybody is in this rat race; recently heavy weight
**Wal-Mart** joined to open their stores in India and even reliance is
now trying to negotiate with france based global retail major
**Carrefour** (which is in air ). Some of the new retail stores are
small and right around the corner competing with family owned generation
old style grocery store. While some are big enough to keep you in their
long maze of aisles for a while. Total turnover of this segment is quite
high as we being second populated nation. Moreover now India has huge
potential as an emerging market and is already a major sourcing base. As
all these new stores try to establish their customer base they throw
away “**Special Offers**” from time to time. It is a quick way to get
attention and make sure cash in-flow is there.

Recently, we got a glossy pamphlet with daily newspaper and thought to
check it out. So went yesterday evening its a nice store neither too big
nor too small maybe size of 7-11 (US) or G20 (FR) to give you a fair
idea(about size).

  

Issue that is making me write this blog is finding a rack full of
**Barilla pasta** at the store called "**SPINACH**". Prices are not very
high for these pastas around *85 Rupees for 500 grams* (it is only 1
Euro in FR).The biggest disappointment was as we checked price of Olive
oil which is *800 Rupees for a 700/750ml bottle*. All I am sure it is
Extra TAX Indian government imposes on importing Olive oil from EU
(Greece or Spain in most cases). No way we are going to make pasta in
India forget the price and availability of a good cheese which is one of
the essential ingredient in making of pasta. Coming to cheese though our
nation produces enough milk neither we have weather nor the technology
to make cheese like emmental, ricotta, mozrilla, parmesan, roquefort or
mascarpone. All you get here from local market is cheddar Ogh!. There
are some stores in South-Mumbai where I am told you get other varieties
for a price. Need to check before I comment.
