Jaya(my cousin sister) and her hubby Purbayan visited us along with
Satyajit on very rainy Sunday. They came to Paris for their own private
concert. They were on a tour to Europe and playing Indian classical
music. Purbayan(sitar) and Satyajit (tabla) are very talented in their
own field.It was our great pleasure to have them as guest. Due to rain
we reached the concert bit late but it was a great performance. An
evening, which I will remember for a long time.A very bad week with
Metro strike ended in delight.You can find lots of web sites...
