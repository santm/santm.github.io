## Brief history ##
The domain [santm.com](https://santm.com) is a self sponsored birthday gift :)
Registered the domain back on Friday the 13th of 2000. Honestly I did not know about [paraskevidekatriaphobia  or triskaidekaphobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triskaidekaphobia) those days it was just a weekend for me.

The website was initially hosted on Yahoo!'s(*Lycos*) free hosting called [Tripod](http://santm.tripod.com/) with static pages. Moved on to shared hosting as creating static page was no fun. You have to track every small changes and I was not using any framework. Started few small php pages but after that it was with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) for a while. Those shared hosting was always slow as never spent too much on the personal hosting. Neither this sites see too many traffics where it can be self-funded by Ads money. Anyway who likes Ads :(   

Moved Google's [blogspot](https://blogspot.com) with custom domain. While it is a great tool for blogging the template choices are very limited and can never trust those free templates with many hidden codes.

Now back to static hosting with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). The theme is a simple, minimalist & responsive build on [Bulma](https://bulma.io) framework made by me. The hosting now moved to [GitHub](https://github.org) pages. 

With rise of social media connecting with friends and family is very easy and the blog section show drastic reduction. There are lots of challenge in migrating service and that always causes many part of the website not to be perfect. But this gives me real life problem to be solved.  I learned a lot in the that process.
