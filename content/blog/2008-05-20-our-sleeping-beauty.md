Aarush never likes to sleep when ever we tried to tuck his hands....I
mean with buritto wrap. If wrapped he keeps on moving his hands in
discomfort until he is unwrapped. He always loves to have his hands
free, outstretched in upward direction. This series of pictures which
were taken during half an hour cat's nap. So many positions for two
little hands :D
