Oof !!!! getting mad you know.Its been a while Santanu is trying his
best to make it work but alas no response,no sound... nothing.Tried his
best as much as he could, took it on his lap, dismantle
everything...like one of those computer geeks trying to fix that damn
thing but god............everything gone in vain.The connections & all
those seems to be fine except that fan which was rotating in such a
speed making hell lot of noise.You know its almost dead....

The CPU was showing 116° C. He did contact [INTEL](http://www.intel.com)
support and the response from them was since he is not using the CPU fan
provided by them for cooling he had broken warranty. But according to
the Shuttle their system is Intel Certified so I am supposed to use the
[ICE (Integrated Cooling
Engine)](http://global.shuttle.com/ "ICE cooling") for cooling the CPU
and system. He posted the same on
[Sudhian](http://forums.sudhian.com/messageview.cfm?catid=43&threadid=89099&highlight_key=y "cpu temp 116")
but it seems like that did not raised many eye-brow. And he found this
too mean for any mini PC or hardware support with big name.

Anywayz, thinking that he might have to buy and spent money on new
hardware he took the whole system to Surcouf. They told him at the
reception to be ready to pay minimum 19 Euros for the diagnosis and
other?. All the technician out there did not look worried about [Static
Electricity](http://www.buildyourown.org.uk/pc-articles/anti-static/) at
all. According to them it is a system problem so they send the same to
Shuttle.

In that way,he is lucky enough as the system is still under warranty.
Now he has to wait 4 weeks minimum for any updates which means it has to
wait for me till he come back from my India trip.*"Waqai, tujh
bin....jiyu kaisey"*. This computer world has got so much integrated
into his private life that hardly he can think of himself without it.
**La vie sans net est difficile a vivre. (see, ;) he can speak bit of
french in frustated mood)**
