Migrated to [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org/) along with
[Gallery2](http://gallery.menalto.com/), the choice for the same was not
easy. As for a long time [Mambo](http://www.mamboserver.com/) and custom
home grown Photo Album was doing the job fine. In fact the template I
used for the same was appreciated by friends. But as days passed and
numbers of pictures are growing it was getting difficult to manage the
same with custom gallery. But the idea to grab Wordpress and dropping
Mambo is a personal one. I will not compare the two. The fact is they
two are different and just I felt like
[blog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog) software will be a better
choice for a personal website compared to a
[CMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Management_System)

Well there is lots of lots work left to organize the pictures now after
this migration as there was no tool or script that I could use to
automate the same :(  Hope to finish this by end of September.
