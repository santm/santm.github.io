Our first trip in Europe, I decided about Amsterdam because of two
reason Van Gogh and people of Amsterdam. To our delight it was really
great and was a great escape from noise and crowd of Paris.The city is
not so big compared to Paris but very clean and friendly. As most
tourist books suggest Dutch people has unique and very efficient
solution to their day-to-day problem. The streets are not crowded with
car.We reached there on Saturday morning and visited Van Gogh museum
followed by Albert Cuypmarkt. We had Surinamese for lunch and Indonesian
for dinner. Both were great. Both these countries were Dutch colony but
you get **roti** in Surinamese cuisine.Sunday we visited Rijks museum.
The main part of museum was closed as they found **asbestos** in museum.
But they had all the major work of Rembrandt and other great Dutch
masters for display and the entry fees was reduced with free audio
tour.Monday we rented bike and biked a lot. Yes a lot for 3 to 4 hrs and
in that time we crossed the south canal belt few times. We had Falafel
for lunch and Nepalese for dinner; the falafel was great I think the
best falafel I tasted so far.Yes it was a great trip, which ended on
Tuesday morning as soon we back to Paris with [general
strike](http://blog.santm.com/2003/05/metro-on-strike.html "Metro Strike")
for 2 week in a row.
