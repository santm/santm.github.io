After figuring out, lots of museum have free entry on first Sunday of
every month we started with our museum tour with **Louvre**. Oh!! It is
a museum in itself. I am sure all of you know some thing or other about
it. We started our tour with Egyptian section last month. We are still
visiting & we think we only covered 1/3rd so far after two Sundays. God
knows how many sundays it will take to complete this whole museum.Some
times it felt like how these people stole so much from Egypt. But again
these practices were quite common in India with all the invaders from
Persia to London. Any way the stronger ones are stealing oils and other
resources from another country now.....
