It was the 27<sup>th</sup> April 02 <span

style="color:green;">evening</span>,



Every thing was geared up for the Mumbai <span

style="color:blue;">meeting</span>,



Our “<span style="color:red;">Rosy</span>” flower, made “<span

style="color:#ff9900;">Shan</span>” like a bee <span

style="color:#993300;">humming</span>,



Not showing outside, Pam thought it was her prince <span

style="color:#993366;">charming</span>,



Santanu was convinced it was the end of  his <span

style="color:fuchsia;">findings</span>,



Gandhiji was nervously <span style="color:olive;">smiling</span>,



Shan’s mother in law thought it was perfectly <span

style="color:blue;">matching</span>,



Pam’s mother and father in law were unable to hide the <span

style="color:red;">exciting</span>,



Sensing wedding bells <span style="color:red;">ringing</span>,



Choton proposed an early ring <span

style="color:#993366;">exchanging</span>,



Everyone in both sides were <span style="color:#339966;">priding</span>,



Thought it was a great <span style="color:navy;">timing</span>,



Then came a series of <span style="color:lime;">e-mailing</span>,



Thousands of miles kept two hearts <span

style="color:navy;">parting</span>,



While Technology brought California & Durg <span

style="color:red;">closing</span>,



And the two did each other some <span

style="color:#ff9900;">measuring</span>,



At Satna there were forgotten few, who were <span

style="color:#3366ff;">guessing</span>,



When at Durg “The Great Jija” felt something <span

style="color:#993366;">missing</span>,



Why his sali’s plum looks gave way to slim & beauty <span

style="color:fuchsia;">tantalizing</span>,



8<sup>th</sup> Nov’02 kept them waiting and <span

style="color:green;">waiting</span>,



14<sup>th</sup> Aug’02 traditional ring ceremony gave some <span

style="color:red;">consoling.</span>



On 5<sup>th</sup> Nov’02, “Jija & Co” left Satna with lot of <span

style="color:blue;">worrying</span>,



And sight of his father <span style="color:#ff6600;">suffering</span>,



Believing everything will be OK till <span

style="color:green;">returning,</span>



Only Shiva knew, Kolkata will be far from <span

style="color:fuchsia;">reaching</span>,



When news at Gaya came like a bolt <span

style="color:red;">thundering</span>,



Your father is no more, came a voice <span

style="color:blue;">grieving</span>.



The “Biye” at Kolkata, started with Agni <span

style="color:fuchsia;">offerings,</span>



Shudh Mantras, the Brahmin was <span

style="color:navy;">reciting</span>,



Santanu’s patience got some <span style="color:green;">testing,</span>



The “destined future “made home and parents from Rosy <span

style="color:#339966;">departing</span>,



Hectic jaunts, (Kolkata to Siliguri to Durg and back to Kolkata) made

both of them <span style="color:#33cccc;">panting</span>,



As Siliguri & Durg were places of “Chaturtha-mangal” and <span

style="color:fuchsia;">partying</span>,



Finally, to California the two birds were <span

style="color:aqua;">flying</span>,



But Hong Kong made them <span style="color:blue;">hopping</span>,



The Album kept us <span style="color:green;">waiting</span>,



We opened to find “<span style="color:red;">Shan & Pam –The perfect

Wedding</span>”
