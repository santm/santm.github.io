Siliguri is gateway to the North East of India. It is commercial city of
North Bengal where **tea, timber and transport** are the main business.
It is a base point to head towards *Darjeeling, Sikkim, kalimpong,
mirik* etc. Besides, it is also the **transit point** for air, road and
rail traffic to the neighboring countries of Nepal, Bhutan and
Bangladesh.

Situated at foot of *Eastern Himalayas* it has very pleasant temperature
but *weather is very unpredictable* as it gets shower any time. Summer
is not like other parts of India which burns in hot lava. It hardly
exceeds 32 C in day time and after every 3-4 days there is a light rain
sometimes short sharp downpour. Winters are really biting cold with
mercury level hardly rising to 15 C at day time. During winter, on clear
day it gives excellent view of Himalayan peaks with an opportunity to
see as backdrop of snow-clad mountains.

In the month of May, we went there for 10 days which was a great escape
from Mumbai’s heat and frequent power failure. These pictures are from
the terrace of my in-law’s house.
