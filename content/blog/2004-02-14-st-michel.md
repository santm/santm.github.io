Perched on a rocky islet in the midst of vast sandbanks exposed to
powerful tides between Normandy and Brittany (on the north coast of
France) stand the 'Wonder of the West', a Gothic-style abbey dedicated
to the Archangel St Michael

It was built in 8<sup>th</sup> century, the buildings of Mont St. Michel
were constructed of granite which were carried from near-by island but
some limestone were also used in the cloister. Its arrogant location
along with abbey's church, cloister, gardens, the north-facing, Gothic
buildings of "La Merveille" (The Marvel), the narrow town streets, and
the ramparts combine to make Mont-Saint-Michel one of France's most
impressive sites. Mont-Saint-Michel and its Bay is a UNESCO world
heritage site

We went to Mont St. Michel on Feb.14<sup>th</sup> for two-day trip with
one travel agency. The day was quite bright but with chilled wind
blowing across. After spending 4 hrs at St.Michel we were shifted to
hotel where we had our early French dinner & proper night sleep so that
we are fresh enough to start for next day?s trip to Cancale on the way
to St.Malo.

Cancale has made its reputation as a fishing port, famous for its
oysters. It?s the place from where granite rocks for St.Michel were
taken. St.Malo a walled town made its reputation as a world port thanks
to its sailors, merchants, and corsair ship owners and to it?s trading
with India, China, Africa and America. Other then its port, miles long
beach attracts visitors for sunbath in summer. The best view of St.Malo
is from its ramparts.
