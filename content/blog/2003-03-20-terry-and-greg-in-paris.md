Terry "long hair" or that Canadian came to Paris from Palo Alto. It was
nice of Terry, Jaroline (Wife of Terry) and Greg to spend two evenings
with us. It was a great as for the first time we had some friends while
dining. The big surprise was Terry got a nice hair cut in Paris at end
of his trip which was a big change. But,I am sorry I did not have a
camera to capture the same.Now, it was time to say goodbye to them just
like others whom we left at Bay Area.Hope to catch up with this crazy
"F\*\*\*" guy some time some where.......
