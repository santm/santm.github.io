Friends and near ones use to ask me quite often then - *Do you feel the
movement?*

***No*** (use to be my reply).

Somewhere, I use to wonder how it feels like the movement of the baby
inside. It was tough to answer as first timer. On routine check -up my
doctor asked the same whether I feel the movement and I nodded in
negative. Immediately asked her how it actually feels. She says like
bubbles or you'll feel tiny flutters as your baby moves â€“ I smiled and
said **yes**. I had my very first experience on 5th month.

There's something really special about feeling your baby's kicking,
squirming. You begin to realize that some life is really inside you and
that is just as exciting as the first time you heard your baby's
heartbeat or caught a glimpse of her moving during the first sonography.

You begin to feel the movements as your baby's bones harden. *Movements
become more intense with hardening of bones as baby grows*. First-time
moms like me usually feel their babies move bit later than experienced
ones.

As naughty as our son already is, he use to kick like as if having
fist-fighting inside or trying to create more space for himself by
stretching. Even his dad could feel his kicks by placing his hand on my
belly. We enjoyed as he use to mark his presence by movements. At
earlier stage it use to be rare but slowly and slowly I felt his kicks
several times a day, every day. It is just amazing! Later even doctor
asked me to keep an count of number of movements. According to her, it
should be 10-12 per day.Certain time felt jabs from his arms and legs.
But **baby does not move all the time**. They have their own patterns.
