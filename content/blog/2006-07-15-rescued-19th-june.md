<span style="text-align: justify;">By now, seeing the time I was
discussing about hitch hiking to the next big town which was ruled out
by Santanu as it seems not safe. Even I was suggesting him how about
getting into a car of people who does not look that young and suddenly
one car stopped and they asked if we need any lift… looking at their
face we did not take a second to decide and say “YES” in unison (which
came out as if instinct) with big smiling face. They really looked
apostil to us. I & Santanu got squeezed at back of the small car along
with our stuffs as the small trunk was already filled up.</span>

See…my wish really came out true….taking lift from nice people with grey
hairs. They were really so gentle which I can’t express by my words. The
lady (Heidi) was more loquacious than her husband. They knew about India
well and been there few times so we had lot to talk about. It really
made it a more of a wonderful trip. But their first question was “what
two Indians are doing at that bus station?” As per initial plan we were
supposed to go to the next town on the road Domodossola in Italy and
continue from there to Locarno. But soon we came to know that they are
also going to Locarno so all the way to Locarno we had nice lively
conversation.

With few minutes halt at Vigezzo where we had coffee –break at nearby
bistro. The main attraction of the village is the church of “Santuario
della Madonna del Sangue”. The original church was build around 14th
century but then it was expanded later on. Its structure is more like
Byzantine one then the gothic which are more common in this part of
Europe.

  
  

On reaching at Locarno they were so much worried for us that they even
helped us in looking for a hotel by asking there local friends & dropped
us to the same. Really so kind of them to take care of us - a great
Swiss hospitality and welcome to strangers.
