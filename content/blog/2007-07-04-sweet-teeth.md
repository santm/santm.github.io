From this Monday I moved to a corner desk as I put a new pair of shoes
at work. The desk is nice but I lost my [view from the
window](http://blog.santm.com/2007/04/13/little-visitor-at-office-window/).
Well, this post is not about my office and work.

  

Our boss is sailing Far-East and we had a dinner at [Marine Plaza
Hotel](http://www.hotelmarineplaza.com/) honoring him. The location of
the hotel is great and as we were a big group we got a hall to ourself
facing Black Bay and Marine-Drive of Mumbai. This windswept promenade is
the crown of Mumai’s attraction. If you are in Mumbai try this location
for an evening dinner - lots of high end hotel to choose from.

The food was good but not an excellent one; it was a buffet - with many
verities of salads, soups and Indian snacks. I hardly had any place for
main course after all those but I saved enough for dessert. There were
around 10 types of them; and you can see I have taken almost all of them
in my plate. I do not recollect any of those fancy names. Chef’s delight
was the ultimate one. I was bit skeptical when taking the big white
dessert, it had a layer of chocolate in the middle to make it yummier.

  

Keeping my palm starched and flat on the key-board I confess I have
sweet teeth. No big secret, I love **\[desire will be a better one to
express my feeling for them\]** desserts particularly chocolates. I love
dark chocolate but I just can not have enough of them at one go.
Unfortunately, I am not getting my daily dose of chocolate as I used to
have after dinner in Paris. In Paris, you even get 100% chocolate which
comes with warning on the wrapper that you might find taste too strong.
Chocolates of main-land Europe particularly from France, Switzerland,
and Belgium are the best. Only chocolate I know and like from Italy is
Ferro Rocher – well enough of chocolates for this post …but never enough
for my tongue.
