Seeing one of friend's photographs we were so excited to visit that
place. That, in our last trip to Amsterdam (May 2003) we tried to visit
that - but alas! Local people told us that Tulip season is already over.
But deep down in our heart we wanted to visit that place particularly
Keukenhof thinking -maybe next year.

Then we were in touch with Holland tourism in-order to know more about
Keukenhof. We tried twice, booking with a travel agency as it would have
been economic & hassle free for us compared to self-trip- but no luck.
Luck at last smiled on us when Krovi & Vidya asked us to join them to
Keukenhof.

We started on April 3<sup>rd</sup> and reached around late afternoon
after 5hrs of driving. Roads to Keukenhof park being well marked in town
of Lisse (very close to Amsterdam) we didn?t had any problem to reach
there

No other flower heralds spring like a tulip, especially after months of
dreary, not to mention cold and bleak, weather. Like a river of clear,
cool water on a hot summer day, our mind's eye feasts on the color and
shape of tulips in early spring. Millions of tulips and other bulb
flowers are then in bloom. As soon as we entered the park there were too
many flowers other then Tulip to catch our attention. It was really
magnificent view & worth going

After spending 3- 4hrs.at Keukenhof garden we went to Amsterdam where we
spent that evening & Sunday there.
