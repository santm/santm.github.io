Calcutta (Kolkata) – **mega city of Eastern India**. In this vibrant
city with a distinct socio-political culture, cabs are grand old
**Ambassadors** from Hindustan Motors and most of cars are manufactured
from the nearby plant of Uttarpara. This picture was taken next to major
long distance Sealdah Railway Station which shows that **city of joy**
still struggles with traffic congestion. Unlike of other major cities
where Tata indica or fiat or Maruti are common hired forms of mechanised
transport this city has almost all taxis as **amby** painted in yellow.

Before Maruti it was the only car on Indian road. This reminds me of my
childhood times when me and my brother used to identify a Mark-II,
Mark-III or Mark-IV by its sound (all these models looked very similar).
It was a stupid game in era of Nintendo –Wii. The game was a simple one
- we used to hide behind a wall as we saw an Ambassador approaching, try
to identify the same by sound and confirm as soon as it passed by from
behind.

While writing this post I just found [the web
page](http://www.hmambassador.com/) of this car and found 10 reasons to
buy this car ……

1.  First Indian car – **\[born in 1950 (inception in 1948. Originally
    based on Morris Oxford ,United Kingdom \]**
2.  Power Steering – **\[Trying to match up the new market with Maruti,
    TATA, Honda and Toyota.\]**
3.  Multi Fuel Injection – **\[Well, all new car has that - what a big
    deal?\]**
4.  Company fitted CNG – **\[Well, you can convert almost every petrol
    car in India to keep your running cost as low as 1 Rupees for 1
    KM.\]**
5.  Tough
6.  Tough - **\[tested on Indian roads for long time but why they have
    to list the toughness twice?\]**
7.  Roominess - **\[Yes, more then 10 people can travel in a single car
    at a given time!!\]**
8.  5 Speed Gear box - **\[Another lame reason, all car now a days has
    the same. \]**
9.  Easy repairable – **\[They claim across the country all mechanic
    knows the car inside out.\]**
10. Serves the country – **\[Used by Indian Army and de-facto car of
    Indian bureaucrats and politicians. \]**

If I have enough money one day I will like to have a chauffeur driven
amby for myself just to hang out in nostalgia or in the roomy car or to
be different from every one else

eleventh reason or may be only reason for having this car**.
