It was a bright and bleak winter day, we headed straight to the number
one attraction of Paris or Europe as you might say. A great view; this
picture was taken by a Japanese tourist. There were lots of people from
Indian sub-continent selling momento of Eiffel Tower for cheap. But we
left after a while, as it was too cold and windy that day to go at the
top of tower.
