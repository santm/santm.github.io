Bengalis are considered as food-lovers (khadya-rashik).For them any
sumptuous *bengali meal is always incomplete without a sweet dish*. Just
like any french meal which would remain incomplete without a bottle of
exquisite french wine.

I was not a big fan of sweet earlier but when you live with someone for
a long period of time, you quickly start to adapt some of your partner’s
habits be it deliberately or inadvertently. Maybe sometimes for the good
or worst - so is my case. My sweet **S** unlike me, does love his sweets
quite ardently. With us, desserts do not necessarily need to be
complicated or fancy; they simply have to be labeled dessert. Sometimes,
only a piece of quality bittersweet chocolate will do especially after
main meal be it lunch or dinner.

Well known Bengali sweets are generally made of milk products and sugar
be it sweetened cottage cheese (chhena), khoa (reduced solidified milk).
Sometimes even flours of different cereals and pulses are used to
prepare and embellished with nuts, raisins or grated coconut.

From quite a long, I was craving for Narkal sondesh (grated coconut
sweet). But somehow things were not in my favour and it didn’t get
prepared. Much like other aspects of life, it takes a bit of
perspiration and lots of inspiration. At last, I had to ask hesitatingly
to my Sondesh guru and my inspirer (mil) to prepare for me which she
accepted it considering my situation…*peut-etre!*

I learnt preparing this from her but today I will recite my joy of
eating for the one she prepared on my request to tantalize my tongue.

  

Simple to prepare

-   **Mix sugar powder and grated coconut paste.**
-   **Place the mixture over the heat and stir constantly to avoid
    lumps.**
-   **When the sugar melts, add milk powder and remove the pan from the
    heat. Stir few more times.**
-   **Add the cardamom powder and mix again.**
-   **Now cool it a little and then smear the stone mold with oil; Press
    sugary-coconut on the mold to decorate their upper surface
    occasionally with help of water.**

These sweets are commonly prepared for religious festival or marriage or
offering to household deity. But as I said, today it was prepared for
me.
