For quite a long was thinking to prepare bread at home which I would
have never thought of in my wildest dream if I was in India. But staying
at Paris it just clicked why not to try once on experimental basis as it
is there staple food. It’s like an icon of France. This is why French
people visit the local **"Boulangerie"** (hot bread shop) at least once
a day and this shop is there at least at every street corner. Filled
with delicious sensations and smells of warm, just-baked bread will
definitely increase your appetite for sure while passing by these
boulangeries particularly at morning and evening time. As this is the
time when fresh bread along with other baked items like **croissant**
comes out of the oven.

While staying at Paris, I often see people riding bikes, mopeds or
motorbikes with baguettes strapped to the back, or walking the streets
with their [baguette](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baguette) under their
arm racing to get home at end of the day. So, it might be another reason
for thinking of baking bread at home.

Anywayz, I wanted to get Santanu’s concern on this matter although
answer was known to me… “No way”. As he said **“no”** now I was bit
determined to do it so was trying to gather all my courage to do the
same by myself when he is not around.

First was to get ingredients particularly leavening agent such as yeast
which I got it from nearby super store rest others are normally there at
our Indian kitchen. As Santanu is bit health conscious so keeping that
in mind I opted for wheat-flour which has superior nutritional value
rather than plain all purpose flour and thought to encrust with either
sesame or poppy seeds to give a special taste.

Well, there is wide variety of breads and preferred varieties often vary
from region to region especially at France. This variation is done by
just manipulating rising times, kneading techniques, and with the use of
especially traditional brick ovens though basic ingredients like water,
salt, yeast and flour remains same. It can be served ranging from room
temperature to hot. But always best to have fresh. This can be used as
an enclosure for sandwiches other then topping it with jam, butter or
cheese. Even it can be served with pasta or as a complement to a crispy
fresh salad or hearty bowl of soup. Once baked, bread can subsequently
be toasted. And its better not to be stored in fridge as it becomes
stale rather one can store in zip-lock plastique so that there is no
room for air to get in.

Here, I used very simple technique as this was my first experiment on
bread and voila unexpectedly my experiment came out quite well then I
thought. Even Santanu was astonished to see that.

Once you have tasted the fresh bread either from boulangerie or
home-made I am sure you will never forget its taste. A crisp, crunchy
crust and slightly chewy, soft spongy center make this bread bit
traditional.
