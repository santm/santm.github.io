**Opinion** – a simple word everyone has one. Thanks to new social media
which makes it so easy to spread it. They express it say it is personal
(me included). Does it really personal once expressed ? I am not a
social science expert but there are some opinions heard, read in recent
time wondered what to do with them.  Tried argue with few at the
beginning but at the end ignored them all. Hope you will do the same, if
not leave your comments.

**Scene-1**<span style="text-align: justify;"> Mr. President visiting CA
and ends up apologizing for a comment which sound natural but did not go
well in media. Sorry Mr. President wrong choice of words everyone has
such high expectation from you. If it was your predecessor may be we
have not read about it Newspaper’s opinion page.</span>  
**Scene-2**<span style="text-align: justify;"> One Chief Minister of
India decides which countries are allowed to play in one Indian state
for IPL. Well she is not the first one to do there was a stage set for
the same in Mumbai long time back. Looks like it is not impacting
cricket much and everyone is happy with IPL Season –Six.</span>  
**Scene-3**<span style="text-align: justify;"> One Indian minister
comments on drought. I am leaving it out and saving myself from
typing.</span>  
**Scene-4**<span style="text-align: justify;"> In Facebook, there are
opinion on Aloe-Vera to politics, economy, technology, history and what
not. Well like top 3 example I could just ignore them or comment or hit
the humble ‘like-button’. Not sure why there is dislike button ? May be
it is more “Gamification process” than “engaging”.</span>  
**Scene-5**<span style="text-align: justify;"> in a recent party heard
people refusing airline based on their country of origin. Does it really
make sense ? </span>  
<span style="text-align: justify;">  
</span><span style="text-align: justify;">The same person avail other
products/services of that same country directly or indirectly for sure
in today’s connect world. Just for the record I was drunk and wise and
remained mute :)</span>  
<span style="text-align: justify;">As said in the first really thinking
on the digital/social context as here I am expressing my opinion without
any heart-full argument on the same.</span>
