Hello Aarush,  

Today you are four months old...though nothing remarkable but for me it
has been days now since we met last. Hope you to be fit as fiddle.

I came to know from your mom that now your vision is focused more or
less, you are trying to grasp objects; can bat and swipe at dangling
toys. It seems now you are ready to rock and roll as you have started
taking side turns with squirms, giggles and wails... You respond to your
nani (granny) and aunt with big toothless smiles as well with coos and
making happy noises. Do you still continue to often soothe and calm
yourself by sucking your fingers; and do you bicycle your legs and wave
your arms when placed on your back with jerky movements.

Hope your head and neck muscles are getting stronger and able to lift
your head to look around. I know that these muscles will still need
support, so we have to be careful to guard your head and neck while
lifting and holding.

Well, enjoy your time with your aunt and two elder cousin sisters. But
do n't get spoiled with too much love, care and attention.

Darling, it seems besides all care and love you are not keeping a good
progress as recommended by your doctor. I just want to let you know that
'am are not worried as long as you are happy and at ease.

Sorry my child, I miss you a lot and hope to see you soon. You are
always in my heart and on my mind.

Loving you... Your's DADA
