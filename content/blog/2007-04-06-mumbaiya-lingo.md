While boarding a train I heard one co-passenger saying to another
“**Tabadtod andar jaane ka**” which astonished me for a fraction of
second as its not at all palatable to an untrained ears. It seems this
“Tabadtod andar jaane ka” is considered far more effective while getting
into locals then long winded formal request to the people ahead to make
way.

I was trying hard to relate as it sounds hindi but actually its not.
After few glitches understood its an intermediary where my knowledge of
hindi helped. Basically its hindi with generous smattering of words
borrowed from *Marathi, Konkani and Eng.* which actually manifests
mumbai’s cosmo culture. In short, its *bhelpuri* of all these languages.

Actually, strength of mumbaiya lingo transcends all barriers. It was not
very long ago that I was torn between *mereko-tereko-apunko* with easy
flow of mera tumhara apnaa. Perhaps part of mumbaiya lingo lies in its
effortless informality. Mind you, there is no "**PLEASE**" in this
lingo. Instead of formal use of hindi I have been with all enthusiasm of
neo-convert dropping **terko wahan jane ka, barobar** etc. Maybe this
quick direct nonsense linguistic approach is also fallout of fast pace
of life in Mumbai. Here, are some glimses -

-   Khali pilli meri khopdi mat satka - Don’t bother me
-   Mera sara moondi ghoom gaya –I got spinned
-   Tereko tension nahin lene ka. – Don’t take tension
-   Kanda, batata for onion and potato
-   Kothmir for coriander
-   Yeah apun kaa ishtyle hai – This is my style
-   Boley toh fir milenghe bhai log – We will meet again
-   Abhi examz bhi khatam ho gaye le, hain na tere??- now, your exams
    have finished,isn’t it?
-   Toh chal fatak se taiyaar honekaa - Get ready quickly

You might hear quite often people having cutting chai at tapri (tea
stall). Now what this cutting chai exactly means I too don’t know.
Certain say its half cup tea but I am not sure yet. Not only that you
may also hear people visiting friends to avoid **kantaal** & know that
if something is **rapchik or jhakkas**. However, you are likely to hear
me switch to *baju hat* or *mujhey chuna nahin laganey ka* with ease.

Even this mumbaiya lingo has attracted our bollywood industry to great
extent from time time. So, when you see me next time don’t be surprised
on hearing my adoption to **informal, rude and funny** mumbaiya lingo.
