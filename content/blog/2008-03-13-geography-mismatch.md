For any fifth grader Mumbai is located in Western part of India if asked
north or south answer will be south. So how can there be a church of
North India which is located in posh south Mumbai in a stone throw
distance from famous Flora Fountain? You may wonder - in the world of
bharat-todo (Break India by new politicians) how all bhaia's(people from
North India Bihar and Uttarpradesh - speaking Hindi) suddenly built a
church for themselves. Well, few centuries back when western
missionaries just started coming to India they came first to Kerala the
very south-west tip of Indian map. And from that part of Mumbai was very
much north. This just demonstrate how relative human direction was at
that time. Let's make our heart big enough to welcome every one as they
are without any prejudice :)
