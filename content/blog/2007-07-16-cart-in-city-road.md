While coming to work this morning **oxen (castrated male) cart**
carrying sugar canes caught my attention. It is not a common site to see
a *bullock cart or hand pulled cart (pulled or pushed by a man)* at the
heart of Mumbai city next to VT Station.

They are not allowed in the main roads of the city but can only move in
the peripheral roads of the city. These kinds of slow moving objects
cause most notorious traffic jam in India. But for poor villagers, these
are the only way to meet their daily needs and feed few hungry stomachs.
**Revealing the very true fact of economic and emotional hardship that
these low-wage workers face on a day-to-day basis.**

  

Cart is being used for ages and still continues to be an important mode
of carrying goods mostly **agrarian goods** even in this modern age.
Although, its popularity has declined considerably but it is very cheap
than any other mode of carriage vehicles.

It has many shapes but the basic idea of transporting material remains
same. It has usually two or four wheels. This cart is made entirely of
bamboos and the wheels are wooden. It is also a very **eco-friendly
vehicle**. Number of men or animal required to push or pull depends on
what being hauled.
