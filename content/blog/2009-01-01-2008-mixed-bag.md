Thinking of 2008... it was an eventful year. We started by adding a new
member to our family after going through lot of apprehension. Now our
new world started to revolve around baby with umpteen number of diaper
changes and sleepless nights, his cries, bowel movement and what
not.....

Pamela's parents were at Mumbai to help us in our happily tough times.
Even before completing two months Aarush left Mumbai for Pamela's
hometown. They spent a cruel summer in Durg from March till June with
temperature soaring high up to 47 ÂºC.

In between in May I moved to Bangalore continuing with the same company.
Domestic reallocation was a Herculean task as I had to manage every
thing myself from finding apartment to movers, closing or transferring
various accounts and establishments. My international reallocation
experiences were like piece of cake compared to this.

In June Aarush had his [rice ceremony at
Siliguri](http://aarush.santm.com/gallery3/index.php/Annaprasanna) which
is elaborate and very similar to Bengali marriage ; in nutshell
exhaustive but full of fun and festivity. After that we three came to
Bangalore directly, the journey form Durg to Siliguri and Bangalore via
Calcutta each time was first long trip for Aarush where he got the taste
of train and flight.

Even before settling properly within a months time I had to travel to
Singapore for 3 weeks on business in September. Pamela managed pretty
well with Aarush by herself.

In October we traveled again to Siliguri to attend a [family
marriage](http://aarush.santm.com/gallery3/index.php/1styear_001/tenth)
for a week.

By November we started to get familiar with Bangalore and its
[surroundings](http://www.santm.com/gallery3/index.php/2008/Bangalore).
Initial days Aarush used to get very uncomfortable after 30 minutes
drive in car but now got accustomed to it and enjoys the same.

Two weeks before we went to
[Mysore](http://www.santm.com/gallery3/index.php/2008/mysore) and
[Coorg](http://www.santm.com/gallery3/index.php/2008/coorg). It was a
great escape with a change and Aarush behaved very nicely as he spent
his first night at hotel. This vacation was a perfect one as we had no
pre-set agenda we moved and stopped as we wished.

We will cherish this bygone moments as we are about to accomplish one
year milestone of our parent hood in few days. I have faced new scale of
challenges through out this year on professional front too. World
economic news yet to bring good news for all of us.
