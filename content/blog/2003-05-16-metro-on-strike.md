It started on Tuesday the 13th. My manager gave me a lift to work. On
the way back I walked, it was long but nice walk through **Bois de
Boulogne**Wednesday, the strike was supposed to end; but it continued in
a French way. So, I have to work hard to fix my bike and went by bike to
work. In that process I got an ache on to my shoulder, which did not
allow me to sleep for a whole week. And the strike continued till
Friday. On Wednesday, Murly after realizing that there is no public
transport, he walked 2 hours to reach work. On the way back some one
showed him a shorter route.Thursday, Pamela after missing two classes
decided to go to her French school and walked across Paris, which took
her one and half-hour to reach only. Returning was not a fun for her
either.On Friday things started getting better and on Saturday it ended
for now.
