It was the day to visit **china town** and particularly **Buddha tooth
relic temple**. Â The day was very bright with little could in the sky.
This is the view from our hotel room looking central Singapore Business
District.

After a good breakfast headed out of hotel. Got down by MRT at China
town & took exit to Pagoda street. One can't miss the colorful row of
shop-houses along that street, with baby blue and yellow flowers painted
all over. This whole area is labyrinth of shops selling all and sundry.
Take a few minutes to explore the Chinese furniture shops close to the
end of this street. Many of the pieces are indeed very beautiful.

I walked straight till South bridge road where there is one oldest Hindu
temple on temple road **SRI MARIAMMAN TEMPLE** whose facade was under
renovation so decided not to enter. So walked straight to Buddha tooth
relic temple & museum. It took us 2 hrs to complete the whole. It was
worth the visit.

Next to this place was *Sago street*. At end of sago street is china
town complex. The most interesting part of the Complex is the wet
market, located at its basement. The Chinese are reputed to eat
everything from hoof to tail, and there's no better place to witness
this than a market in the heart of Chinatown! You will be greeted by the
sight of turtles, eels, pig trotters, live frogs being skinned and a
fascinating array of fresh meat and seafood. Colorful tropical fruits
and vegetables are abundant. There are also dry and preserved goods
stalls selling a myriad of Chinese culinary needs from sharks' fin to
century eggs. The market is busiest and at its best in the morning as
told by one shopkeeper. I boycotted this part as I won't be able to eat
anything later.

Took left turn to Terengganu Street which ends at Pagoda street. This
street is crammed with shops selling clothes, antiques, wood carvings,
etc. The goods are not sold at fixed prices, so one can test bargaining
skills here. But while walking around I came across one juice shop
selling juices of cactus to orange. Decided to have **Bitter Gourd
juice** just for change. Not bad though. From there we came back to
hotel to freshen our self at late afternoon and then in evening left for
***IKEA*** where we had dinner.
