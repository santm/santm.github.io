Normally, I and Santanu don't talk to each other on bus, train, flight
or whatsoever as we are normally lost in our own world and both try to
respect each others silence. We have books, newspaper, ipod for that
time but this particular evening we happened to talk so much while
returning to Zurich from Luzern. One of the reason maybe that by now we
are kind of used to watching beautiful sceneries from train as it runs
along lakes, rivers and creaking sometimes as it passes by the running
hills unfolding before us.

Anywayz, it was almost 20 minutes left to reach Zurich when one lady
from back seat of Santanu came to us asking ----

**<span class="orange">  
</span><span class="orange">Lady - "Do you speak English? </span><span
class="green">Santanu - Yes, we do</span>(replied enthusiastically
thinking may be she overheard something and want to ask us
something)<span class="orange">Lady - I think you might not have noticed
that sign (pointing to the picture showing silence compartment on
opposite window) as its not there in your window. You are in silence
compartment.</span><span class="green">Us – (in unison) Oops!!! –
Sorry</span>**

Dumbfounded to hear that; we had been talking non stop for a while now.
It was so silly of us that we did fail to notice none of our
co-passengers in that compartment were speaking. We traveled almost many
schanghain countries but never happen to come across like that. Being
unaware that even a compartment like this can exist we could not express
our feelings to each other (Hain! aisaa bhi hota hai) till we reached
Zurich and got out of that train.

  
We were not hurt by her comments but it might have been better and less
humiliation if she warned us before, not waiting for the very last
moment.

  
YES, it was another new experience with Swiss Railway, next day while
traveling on a normal compartment Santanu silently sneaked into one of
this special compartment to get this picture.
