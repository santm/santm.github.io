Officially it is over… ten month long journey came to an end. There were
two exams and one submission before pulling the final curtain by
November end.

Before writing further I must thank Pamela for persuading me in
enrolling in to this Executive MBA (EXMP) of IIM Bangalore.

The course in nutshell covers almost all the areas of management and
gives you enough foundation to build your own interest in specific area.
The classes were interactive and a very big positive to attend this kind
of program compared to other offerings where you attend classes via
Video. The green campus was retreat where you get detached from the
outside world for few hours in the weekend. This really recharges your
energy level as you do not have any boss to manage.

Well, to answer how much I recommend the course to someone “**is a mixed
bag**” if I put it in few words; another answer would be “**It
depends**” a typical management answer for most situations.

In general, the faculty is an esteemed and one of the best in India.
Most of them have got their Master and Doctorial degree from renowned US
universities. Some were able to connect to profession like us better and
quickly as they had significant industry experience /exposure.

But few tried to impose values and teaching methods which are more
suited for full time students. I personally found those sessions were
not as effective as others. Overall learning part was not great as I was
looking for some performer who can “*walk the talk*”.

I really could not appreciate the current evolution system that was
practised for EGMP. It seems there was no evolution method few years
earlier. As more and more corporate started to sponsor this program they
(HR department) demanded a way to find out if their employees are
effective or not. And every professor before starting the subject would
mention that there will be a small evolution but you should focus on
learning rather than the exam part. For most subjects we had a multiple
choice short exam. I really hated this part; as from engineering days I
have already mastered the art of getting relatively OK grade by
investing a small amount of time.  For those subjects where there was a
submissions or project I think my learning and take away is much more.

Other then learning,One more  positive aspect is you can build network
with like minded people.

First thing I need to do is to list all the recommended books by all
those professors I noted in various notes. And ensure that I buy and
read them in next 18 months.

P.S One class mate quit his job and did really well in class exams with
**"A" grade;** best part he reached final of
[CAPSIM](http://www.capsim.com/ "CAPSIM") as individual 5th Indian to do
so.
