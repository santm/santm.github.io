Claws sharp & eyes wide  
looking for target present on site.   
You may think this to be a sniper  
but its your neighborhood falcon.    
This good boy is quite under appreciated  
killing soldiers of nether word.  
Who destroy grain and plunder world into disease  
RATS, soldiers of satan  
meet their end with this formidable warrior  
But is he a hero to mankind  
while his species  face extinction.  
Homes razed and their babies smuggled  in and out  
is it a saviour or needs saving.   
This shows mankind's cruelty  
tie to respect the real hero,  
who saved the world from horror.
