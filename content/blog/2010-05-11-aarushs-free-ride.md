Well another small post with pictures. These pictures of **Aarush** are
months apart. One on left with motorcycle are just after his tonsuring
and on the right are just weeks old. He really likes to ride like any
other boy. And if we try to stop him it does not go well at public
place. When we were in **Star Bazaar @ Kormangala** few weeks back he
remembered where this toy car was kept and every time we tried to
refrain him he used to go back there. It was surprising that he
remembered where the escalator was and went up all the way navigating
those aisles of merchandise from the lower floors. Recently, we bought
him a cycle from **Fisher-Price** which he rides inside home all the
time. The picture of that is there in [this
album](http://aarush.santm.com/gallery3/index.php/My-3rd-year/28th-month/)
will try to capture a **video** some time soon.
