This thali is named after a small town of South western coast of India
**Udupi** near to **Mangalore**. It is famous for Krishna temple where
from udupi (also called udipi) cuisine got originated. It is basically
delicious vegetarian cuisine with *no onion, garlic* as commonly found
in rich north Indian cuisine. Udupi cuisine comprises dishes made from
grains, beans, vegetables. The variety and range of dishes are wide and
a *hallmark of this cuisine is the use of locally available
ingredients.*

Udipi thali is very common in Mumbai where food is mostly served in
Steel plate; but at certain resto you have choice of Plantain leave.
Eating with bare hand is more fun although spoons are available.
Normally, meals you get are with unlimited serving except the Sweet Dish
(Only one portion of Sweet Dish is included like kheer or kalajamun).
Service is very fast and before you blink your eyes you have the meal in
front of you even at peak hours; hardly sometimes one has to wait for 10
min. at max. The menu is not at all spicy nor rich in oil but very close
to **ghar kaa khana** (everyday meal). That is one main reason these
places are very crowded during lunch hours.

But in recent times non-vegetarian variation of the same cuisine is
making marks not only in India but across the world. Sea food cooked in
coconut and whole red-chillies are one of the common one.

**Bon Appetite** â€“ bien sur, while you tear off a small morsel of
Chappati, dip and devour the taste of authenticity.
