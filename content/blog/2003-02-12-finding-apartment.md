It was now time to find a roof in Paris . But this day was the first day
we really went out in Paris. We were only 5 days old in Paris and the
relocation lady started with a very very bad apartment and kept on
showing till we found a one of our budget with lots of discomfort.
however,Pamela was very skeptical about this place but somehow we agreed
on this after doing lots of calculations.
