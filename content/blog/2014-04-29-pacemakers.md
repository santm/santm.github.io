Believe I shared it before  many times, my likeness of an active
lifestyle. It was not  new to me but last year  found like minded group
and joined them and now i can say i do exercise few times a week. A
passion drives us to wake up at 4 AM twice on weekdays to reach stadium
and start workout by sharp 5AM.  It is tough but once you reach there
and start your day the whole day I find myself with plenty of positive
energies.

  

This group is called [PaceMakers](http://www.pace-makers.in/) and it is
under the guidance of coach KC. He is a veteran runner  with many
accolades. It also  feels like a being part of  big family.
