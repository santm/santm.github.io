**Black and yellow** metered taxi’s made famous by Bollywood movies play
a major role of public transport in Mumbai other then auto rickshaws,
trains and buses. In New York they are **yellow**, in London they are
**Black** and in Mumbai they’re both yellow and black. They are part of
Mumbai heritage. Normally, they move in snail space at peak hours which
may depend on the area traversed and the state of the roads. Truly, at
times cannot help to mention their weird way of driving.

**Few facts:**

-   These **metered** taxis ply throughout Mumbai otherwise only mode of
    hired transport in proper Mumbai as auto-rickshaws are not allowed.
    Bandra on western and Sion on central line marks the demarcation
    point. This is a big bliss as there is not much noise pollution, no
    mad driving and not much squeezing on road for space.
-   They are quaint vehicles which are **quite reasonable in price to
    hire, even if short on leg room, seat comfort, ceiling height, and
    window space.**
-   They also run in share mode, maximum of four person can share the
    ride but routes are fixed for this kind. Mostly Mumbai-ans uses them
    to reach office from station or vice versa.
-   All most 99% black and yellow cabs are **Premier Padmini** by FIAT
-   FIAT does not produce these car any more so all cars on the road are
    20/30 years old.
-   They run on CNG (*that is the only reason taxi fair did not got a
    hike in last few years*).
-   Fixing the car is easy, not much electronic like new car. Each
    driver knows his car’s technical fine points like his palm.
-   Taxi drivers in Mumbai are still OK; not as honest like old times
    but better off from their counterparts in any other major cities in
    India.

Though there are new air conditioned taxi on the road which are yet to
become mainstream. These will be **air conditioned and fitted with GPS,
cordless phones, electronic meters with printers. These new taxis will
charge a little extra** than the traditional black and yellow taxis
because of the luxury frills.

Even recently one Cab Company has decided to employ ladies driver
catering mainly to ladies passenger and this service will be started by
this November.
