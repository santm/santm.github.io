[![](../images/thumbnails/2006-07-30-green-plate-smoothie.jpg)](../images/2006-07-30-green-plate-smoothie.jpg)In
my salad days I used to hate many green veggies and I remember when maa
used to scold me for the same. Somehow I didn’t had taste for them at
that point of time but gradually I developed the taste so much so that I
can now survive happily on those green things (cow-food).

From long time Santanu wanted to make a change on our meal as it seems
we both are putting on weight. As I said in my [earlier
post](http://blog.santm.com/2006/07/26/yum/) that he tries to encroach
that small part of the house mostly in weekends so he made sure atleast
2 days in week we have [salad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad) in
our main course meal.

  

  
Having salad has got few plus points like less time consuming to
prepare, don’t heat up a hot kitchen, very healthy especially in this
hot Paris summer…..which means salad season. Besides **watermelon or
strawberry smoothie**, salad is the perfect summer food. They're light,
crisp and refreshing-- especially when paired with a dressing and
they're versatile with one’s imagination can invent.

At the core of most summer salads is lettuce. It was viewed for years as
a tasteless part of a salad that used to be covered up with a thick,
sticky dressing. But what a metamorphosis lettuce has seen in the last
10-15 years. Interestingly, new lettuces with various shapes, sizes,
colours and flavours have started replacing the ubiquitous iceberg
lettuce in supermarkets. The assortment of gourmet lettuces available to
the consumer is getting better all the time.

  
So we had this lettuce leaves with deseeded olives, cherry tomatoes &
cheese which was enrobed with a salad dressing of balsamic vinegar,
olive oil and few drops of lemon juice. At end drizzle it with salt and
whisk together in a large shallow bowl. One can serve in small portions
as an accompaniment to roast chicken, or grilled or poached fish. This
dressing is actually to highlight not to overpower the salad
ingredients. Too much salad dressing will weigh down the salad
ingredients and mask their flavors. So...

Bon Appetite bien sur !!!
