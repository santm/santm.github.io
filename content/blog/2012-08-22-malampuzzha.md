After being guest of GK Homestay for 2 nights at 7.00 we hit the road
towards Malampuzha. It is about 8 km from the Palakkad town; Palkad is
known as gateway between Tamilnadu and Kerala as it is a valley between
hills. It is major rice growing area and home of many Tamil Brahmins who
are living in Kerala for centuries.

  

Malampuzha Garden is build next to reservoir on river with same name. It
has a mini hydro-electric project. The garden in that has a scenic
setting with the forested hills of Western Ghats forming the backdrop.
Just like Brindhvan garden of Mysore is build next to a reservoir on
River Cauvery.

  

The garden consists of a unique ropeway that allows visitors to move
around the whole area. The park includes flowerbeds, pools, snake
garden, Japanese garden pedal boats, aquarium & etc. The whole park was
under renovation and only spent some time in children area where Aarush
like the Helicopter a lot. Within the Malampuzha Gardens is a large
cement sculpture named **Yakshi** by **Kanayi Kunhiraman** which you
like or dislike there is nothing in between. Kanayi is the most famous
living sculpture of Kerala and his work are displayed across Kerala
which are huge and very modern. With traditional Kerala his sculptures
sometime looks out of place.

We stopped at Hotel Tripenta opposite Rock Garden for lunch. The food
was OK best part the restrooms were clean. We liked it and wondered with
many ‘w’ questions about the nice property as it is really off-track but
has modern amenities like swimming pool & etc.

  

The rock-garden is the only one of its kind in southern India - inspired
by **Nek Chand Saini**, the artist who made **Chandigarh’s famous Rock
Garden**. All the art is made with recycled materials. The best part was
the rock Garden was almost empty and recently renovated under the
supervision of Nek Chand Foundation. We took many pictures and really
they are beautiful and worth spending some time here.

  

Around 4.00 pm we started our journey back; crossed Coimbatore before
dusk and continued driving. This was a change from the morning plan as
initially we thought of spending one night in Palakkad. It was a long
long drive; we stopped at Salem for a quick dinner around 9 PM and
continued driving all the way to Bangalore.
