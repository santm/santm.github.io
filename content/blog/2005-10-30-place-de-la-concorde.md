<span style="text-align: justify;">After a long time I was able to
capture the fountain of </span>**Place de la Concorde**<span
style="text-align: justify;"> in a very beautiful sunny morning. It is
so amazing that we still take pictures of Paris like tourist on their
first day. When we left home it was cloudy and we were questioning
ourselves why we are carrying the camera with us. But luckily it was
worth to do so. Then from there we took a small promenade at the garden
of Elysee.</span>  

  

While walking in 5th arrondissement we saw preparation for a big
renovation is going on at Madame Curie University (Jussieu) as they used
asbestos as insulator, But with high risk of cancer now government is
trying to get rid of the same. It has unique architectural plan which
resembles as a molecular matrix where each column is numbered. Looking
at the same you can like it or hate it there can not be any middle
opinion about the same.
