<span class="underline">**A brief about Paris:**</span>Paris is divided
in 2 main parts by the River Seine; the left bank and the right.
Traditionally the city was divided just like a human brain left one for
art and music where right one for money and power. Now there no such
difference any more. It has 20 districts or arrondisement in a snail
pattern starting at the center of Paris.

order\]**</span>There are lots of Photos from Paris in <span

**Few Tips:**

-   Be aware of pickpockets and small thefts.
-   Paris is a small City it is only 15KM by 10KM.
-   Ask for a metro Map when you get here.
-   It involves a lot of walking so get yourself a good pair of walking
    shoes.
-   There are not many public toilets and you need to carry change
    \[coins\] to use them.
-   Get yourself a phone card from "TABAC" \[where you buy cigarettes\]
    for calling inside and outside France. There are special cards for
    India or US if you need any.
-   Metro tickets you can buy the 10 tickets "carnet" or day pass
    depending upon your travel plan. You can use the same on any other
    public transport as long as you with in Paris.
-   Each Street corner will have road names and tells you which
    arrondisement you are in.

  

**Getting a place to Stay/ Hotel:**It is expensive when it comes to
hotel in Europe and Paris in particular. The rooms are small and
expensive. Personally I think if you get a hotel around Latin Quarter
that is 5th, 6th is best as you are close to city center and the
locality is nice. 7th, 8th are also good with 1st to 4th. Paris is very
safe city in general. I personally do not like the area around the big
Train stations of Gare de Nord and Gare del'Est The 18th,19th and 20th
are should be avoided from my own prospective and you have happen to
stay in 13th-16th make sure your hotel is not very far from Metro
Station as these are more residential arrondisements with metro stations
not very close by like center of city.

**Food:**Few lines about French food; if you do not take fish and a
Indian vegetarian then there are not many choice for you L. Fish and Sea
food is very common in French cuisine; it is almost considered
vegetarians some times. But the pastry, bakery products and chocolates
are delicious I am not joking.But there are lots of Indian place to
choose from but make sure you ask for right amount of spices as it is
very scaled down for locals.
