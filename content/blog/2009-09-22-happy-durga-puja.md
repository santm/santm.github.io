Hello everyone, happy festivity it is time of celebration in India
specially  north and east where it is NavaRatri in North and Durga Puja
in East. Pamela and Arush left on Sunday for Durg. It will be almost
after 8 years Pamela will be at her mother house to celebrate Durga
Puja. For Bengali's it is the most special occasion in the whole
calender.  According to mythological believe Goddess Durga is a daughter
of every Bengali  and she visit her parents with her four children.

For me life had been very hectic at work in last months after coming
back from Singapore. At times I felt new heights of  anxiety and
pressure which i have not experienced yet.  In way it was a good
learning but I questioned myself do I  have the material enough to get
me to the of the leader. Well may be I am reading too many Harvard
Business Reviews. I am really looking forward a great ending of this
course now. Wish I could plan for our next vacation; since  March when
we did not went out Bangalore together. I am already dreaming for
Andaman

I am counting my days for the upcoming camping trip that I am supposed
to take on 1st week of October.  I got all my camping grear out of
various boxes which have not seen any action in last 5 years after I
left Sunny California.

Pamela has kept [Aarush's picture
website](http://aarush.santm.com/gallery3/) update. She is really great
as she always updates that twice a weeks as soon she gets her chance to
sit down with computer. But really at times I  feel this blog space is
not getting enough updates it should get.  Wish we both could do the
same with the blog; I should  write soon after coming back from the
camping trip.
