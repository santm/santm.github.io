Most of my Web Site is dedicated to photography. In fact, the very
thought of sharing pictures has changed with internet. I like to see
pictures in-print myself. But when you have friends half way accross the
globe, internet is your best friend.The pictures in these albums are
taken by three different cameras. The first camera I had a Pentax. Now I
have a Nikon N-80 and recently bought a Digital camera from Olympus.
Infact, I liked all of them and I am very much impressed with their
results.I used Yahoo!, Ofoto and Nikon club to share my pictures. But,
the problem is they all are great in there own way. I spent a good deal
of time myself to organize all the albums so that, I have same look for
all the pictures.
