Monsoon is about to end. So begins the celebrations and festivals across
India. Any Indian festival is incomplete without the typical Indian
festivities, the gatherings, celebrations, exchange of sweets and gifts,
lots of noise, singing and dancing. *Festivals are the celebration of
not only togetherness but also being part of the family*.

In India, monsoon follows **FIFO** (first in first out) model so the
festivals. As the fields look brilliant with a bountiful harvest; the
beautiful landscape of greenery can be seen in its full radiance at this
time. Starting with **Onam** - the harvest festival of Kerala (the
southern most state) where monsoon was first to arrive. Almost in same
time, in other parts of India month of **Shravan** is considered to be
the holiest month of the year which begins with festival of
**Naga-Panchami.** When each Monday of this month, known as **Shravana
Somvar**, is devoted to the worship of Shiva as this day is sacred to
**Lord Shiva** and is specially observed with austerity. Thus, it marks
the begin of festivals one after another.  

Basically, festival for Indians means its time to get new clothes, to
get their house painted or everything else they asked for or thought of.
Time for family get-together where numerous uncles, aunts and grandmas
grace their wishes with delight. It is also a time for homecoming for
people staying away from the families. Their arrival multiples the joy
of the festival several folds. Observing and following the festivals
from childhood gets so much in blood that every Indian tries his best to
observe the festival in customary way even if they are settled abroad.
Thus, passing it from generation to generation.

People of all religions, castes and communities celebrate their festival
with equal joy and verve. Peculiarity of this land is where unity had
always coexisted with diversity, especially during festivals when people
come together to celebrate life’s unlimited joys.  

Despite rejoicing and gaiety, thanks to the **string of festivals** we
celebrate in name of numerous *Gods and Goddesses* other then those
anniversaries (birthday-deathday) of great men of India. Thus, providing
us with numerous holidays if not ***“bundh”*** without longing much for
weekends as yet in India the concept of 5 working days is not there in
majority of work-place.
