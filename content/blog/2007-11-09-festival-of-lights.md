Today as we celebrate Indiaâ€™s grand festival of Light signaling triumph
over evil after a protracted fight which is marked by lighting of oil
based traditional earthen or clay lamps as they shine brightly in each
and every home - Be it lowly or mightily from the hut of the poor to the
mansion of the rich when good with all its might, leads us from darkness
to light. A day when old and young indulge in royal feast on this
festival of snacks and sweet.

For one and all we pray gift of light -  
Wherever you travel, may a star lead you  
The wind be at your back and road rise to meet you  
Let God holds you in hollow of his hand.

**Wishing you all a very happy, prosperous and safe Diwali**
