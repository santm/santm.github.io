Just back from a week-long trip of Kerala. We left on a Monday quite
unusual day to start a trip, always there is something new to do. We
left home at 4:10 AM and b'cos of that we had almost zero traffic in
crossing Bangalore city and every toll both we did had any queue and by
7:30 we reached Salem and stopped for Breakfast. Post breakfast we had
to cross Salem and by 12ish we are in the border of Tamil Nadu & Kerala.
We had to drive through Thani, Cumbummettu as direct road to Thekkady
via Gudalur was closed from recent rain and flood of Kerala.

  

Just before our journey, there was a RED alert for a new cyclone which
was later withdrawn but we did get rains first 2 days b'cos of that.

  

We stayed in **Club Mahindra Thekkady** for 3 nights. We did not do any
homework before this trip and overreaching there realized all forest
walks were off limit for Aarush as he is not yet 12 years old.

I did one jungle walk the next day (Tuesday) with one guide alone as
there no other guests but it was in a way good as he dedicated all his
time to spot birds for me. Post that we drove all way to Vagamon *(I ran
an 80KM Ultra this year)* so wanted to show Pamela and Aaarush the <span
style="background-color: #f6d5d9;">scenic </span>Suicide Point. While
driving we crossed many tea garden and coffee estate and spice gardens.
Evening we saw a **Kathakali** performance.

Wednesday Morning, we as a family did the boat ride in Periyar and saw
many more birds. But October is not the best season as the best season
starts from November to February when many migratory birds also come
there. Around noon we drove till Gavi point, but we were the only
tourist there so could not do much. That evening for the first time it
did not rain :)

  
Thursday, we started from Thekkady in the early morning and headed for
**Munnar** to witness **Neelakurinji**. These wildflowers only come once
in 12 years but due to heavy rain the picture perfect moment was not
there. But we had to drive again and headed to **Thattekad** (Salim
Ali bird sanctuary). We did a night walk with our guide and spotted
**Great-eared Nightjar.**

  

Friday, we did we moring bird watch but rain from the beginning of the
week was not helpful as even though the weather was better we could not
spot many birds.

  

Post birding we decided to move back to Bangalore and started from there
around 12 Noon.

  

After 3 stops along the route, we reached home post-midnight, traffic
within Bangalore was not a welcoming one as it took almost an hour to
cross (in)famous Madiwala junction.
