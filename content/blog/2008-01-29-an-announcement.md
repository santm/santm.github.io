This announcement was long due on our blog. Though this breaking news
was shared on d-day instantly with friends and families from Hospital
via SMS and emails. I specifically carried my camera, laptop and
wireless data card for the same.

I created two announcement cards one in pink and other in blue with two
names (for girl and boy) and kept them ready. We never disclosed this
big-news in last few months in our blog in-fact it was kept secret to
many except close family members and few friends. Promise to update blog
with those tense and waiting events as those eight and half month passed
by. Frequent readers of our blog might got a hunch that there was no
travelogue in recent time.

Right now life is bit busy with as we try to master ourselves in art of
wrapping (buritto) and changing nappies. I do not see myself awake in
front of computer late in night for coming few months.

Just uploaded [few pictures](http://aarush.santm.com/gallery3/) of
Aarush, as he just completed 11 days today.
