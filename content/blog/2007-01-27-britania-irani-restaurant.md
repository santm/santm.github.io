**Ballard Estate** is old corporate park in Mumbai where most of the
buildings have high ceiling and windows a left-over from British Raj. I
feel very fortunate as my workplace is on this street and moreover when
I get bird's eye view of Mumbai from my desk.

  

For lunch, I have walked past Britannia before but for some or other
reason I did not entered. It is one of Bombay's famous old **Irani
(Persian)** restaurants situated at Ballard Estate. This no-nonsense,
no-frills, 90-year-old restaurant is the last of a dying breed of
establishments once found on every corner of South Mumbai. The
environment is simple and functional, with little room for extras like
presentation and ambiance. **There is no love greater then love of
eating** - is their motto. It is mentioned on the menu food will be
served within 10 minutes and they really do so. A must if you don't like
vegetarian food you might want to drop-in. There is a different menu for
each day of the week. Apart from the fact that it is the stuff of
legends, the building was designed by George Wittet, the architect of
the Gateway and the Museum.

  

I was lucky one as there was **Berry-pulao** that day one of their
speciality. Berry pulao (a version of the Iranian zereshk polow) is the
outstanding signature dish, made with succulent spiced boneless mutton
(or chicken), fragrant long-grain basmati rice, and tart barberries
imported from Iran. Though it was rich and heavy but its worth - once in
a while.
