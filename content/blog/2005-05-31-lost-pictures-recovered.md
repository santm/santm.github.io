After discovering that one of the SmartMedia Card from my Camera not
working at Seville we were really very heart broken and anxious. It had
pictures from our first three days of our trip. And in those first three
days we traveled from Madrid to Granada. We had captured lots of evening
pictures in Madrid and sunset view of Alhambra at Granada.

But we kept our nerve cool and continued with other media cards and
tried our best not to remember about the same. Getting home and after
finishing lots of house hold chores at late evening we started trying
Google for an answer. And quickly it became clear that we were not the
only one with this problem. The commercial solutions offered were OK but
bit pricy($40) for one time use. Since those pictures were precious to
us, so I tried to buy the same over internet and my credit card got
declined.

But today my luck was better as I found a better web site with lot of
good links(shareware) for the same. Check out, if you happen to have
same problem in future (touch wood).

Well time to go to bed and prepare pictures for posting them on web.
Adios
