On day 2 we woke up late from bed took a stroll in the backyard then
decided to walk towards main market to book our return trip and to have
breakfast. On the way we had strawberry from street corner as its very
common people selling it through out same product. We booked our return
bus trip and were asked for shared taxi at 175 Rs for **Mahabaleshwar
darshan** which we accepted. Walked on main bazaar street of
Mahabaleshwar which is full of quaint shops that are certain to catch
your fancy.

Its bit hot at noon in this time of year. We had [Kateâ€™s
point](http://www.santm.com/gallery3/index.php/2007/mahabaleshwar/dosa%3EDOSA%20%3C/a%3Ein%20our%20lunch%20at%20near%20by%20restaurant%20and%20returned%20to%20our%20cottage%20where%20Santanu%20had%20nice%20time%20reading%20RD%20at%20backyard%20of%20the%20cottage%20and%20I%20took%20a%20beauty%20sleep.%20At%20the%20anointed%20time%20taxi%20came%20and%20we%20were%20ready%20to%20hit%20exploration%20button%20which%20included%20%3Ca%20href=),
**Echo point, Needle hole, Venna lake, Lodwick point, Elephant head and
sunset point.**

Sunset point called Bombay Point being close to our MTDC resort, is the
expansive view of the sunset considered to be one of the most beautiful,
popular and oldest sights in Mahabaleshwar. But too crowded with
tourists and people come here to ride on horse and get themselves
photographed with horse stunts and backdrop of sunset. It got its name
since it was on the old road to Bombay.

Next day started return trip in the morning; we got to enjoy the whole
journey in those semi-comfy chairs of bus. Otherwise we had to face hair
raising stunts from some of the crazy drivers in those winding and
hair-pin bending roads.
