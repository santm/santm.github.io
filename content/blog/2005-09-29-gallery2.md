Well I am having lots of trouble with a simple gallery2 installation
with 15 pictures for my wife's hobby pictures. While I am running a 1600
picture gallery on the same server with out any problem touch wood. The
back on the main one not there.  
  
And i am having wonderful tech support from dot5 hosting to say the
least. The guy does not even know what is Unix he replies it is
FreeBSD.  
  
A quick a dirty way to get around. Let's name the site as www.mysite.com
Here the user name for your web server is not same as your account. So
when you create a file ftp you see the owner/group as "joe/joe" and when
web server creates it it is "web/web".  
  
Connect via ftp create a gallery2 directory ; chmod 777 the same on the
Top most Document root.  
put this file in the same directory "gallery-2.0-full.tar.gz" make sure
binary more  
also FTP this php file foobar.php with these lines in it  

&lt;?  
system ("tar -zxvf gallery-2.0-full.tar.gz") ;  
?&gt;  

Now connect to this foobar.php via a web browser.  
  
Follow the instruction from gallery2 installation when you point your
browser to this location  
  
http://www.mysite.com/gallery2/  
  
Need to create the g2data directory and chmod 777 via ftp again .  
  
to finish the same Gallery will ask you chmod 755 gallery2 directory.
