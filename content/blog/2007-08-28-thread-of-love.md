It is a celebration of unconditional love between brother and sister in
Hindu culture. This age old celebration tries to remind us of the
beautiful and unique relationship between brother and sister celebrated
since time immemorial. Sisters tie sacred threads on brothers wrist
asking for longer & healthy life of brother and brothers in-turn vow to
protect (to save her- **Raksha**) their sisters from any unpleasant
situations of life on this day. It is *not necessary that the rakhi can
be given only to a blood brother but any male can be “adopted” as a
brother by tying a rakhi to a cousin or friends*.

Be it the people in echelons of power, the inmates of the much talked
about Tihar Jail, the city’s high profile glitterati, the Generation X
crowd or poor - Rakhi is celebrated by all with same faith and
traditional gaiety. It is a festival that binds the whole Indian family
living in India or abroad together. The joyous meeting, the rare family
get-together, that erstwhile feeling of brotherhood and sisterhood calls
for a massive celebration in todays busy life.

Time old symbol of love and faith, Rakhi thread has changed tremendously
in its appearance and outlook in present times. Besides being an
expression of love, Rakhi today, is a piece of art and a style statement
for the fashion conscious generation of today. People of amchi Mumbai
celebrate today Raksha Bandhan in style and festive grace.
