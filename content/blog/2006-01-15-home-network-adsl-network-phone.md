I just wanted to share my home network. It is not a state of
technologies with the latest & greatest wireless or wired network with
complex router and switches. I did it in old school way with a **single
long CAT5 Ethernet Cable**. I have a FreeBox which is an ADSL2 router
connecting to the main phone jack. The output from the
**[FreeBox](http://www.free.fr/ "Free") connects my PC, Television and
Phone**. Now all these components are connected with the single wire as
I mentioned before. It takes benefit of the fact out of 8 wires in an
Ethernet cable only 4 are used for network; the pins 1-2 and 3-6 of RJ45
are used. The connection is simple, wire from pin 1 to pin 1 of the
other side and like wise.Similarly, I use the other two pairs for
telephone and ADSL.

So here is the basic block diagram as picture can express more

The input of ADSL router is a simple RJ11 connecting with 2 wires.The
connection between PC and router is 4 wires with RJ45 (2 pairs, one pair
for transmit and other for receive). The phone needs only one pair RJ11.

These pictures show RJ45 connections in detail and also a picture of
backside of freebox.  
  
  
  

The success of doing this by oneself depends on one's skill of how good
one is with **crimp tool** as the connections sometimes are not proper
and one has to repeat the whole process right from the start. Doing a
search for **making rj45 cable connections** on web will lead to more
details. Need any more tips on the same please drop me a line.
