With all its busy, speedy life I found courtesy still existing within in
Mumbai-local; an unexpected encounter with refined human behavior in
this Maximum city. I was retuning home in a local train and lucky to be
seated as I started from VT terminus. In the mid way a family of three
boarded the train; it is quite out of the way for a female passenger to
get into general or male compartment at the rush hour. This is one of
the unwritten but well defined codes of Mumbai local. Female passengers
never try to get in to the general compartment as they will be squeezed
by male passengers.

After few minutes of thought and hesitation within myself I offered my
seat to the lady by signaling her husband. It was a relief for them as
they both mother and son were able to sit.

Suddenly I found a gentle touch on my shoulder; looking back I saw
another gentleman is offering his seat to me as he is getting down.
Normally the person who is standing next to the seat will be having his
turn and it will be big “Faux pas” if someone else grabs the seat. It
was an acknowledgement of my good karma by fellow passenger which threw
me in astonishment. Needless to repeat again when every one is ready to
grab others neck in this metropolis - it is a pleasant experience which
I might have to cherish for a long time to come.
