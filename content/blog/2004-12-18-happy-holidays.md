**Happy Holidays!!!**
---------------------

Well year 2004 is almost over; wish you all the best for the year 2005
and next. This year we did not traveled like last year. But we did
traveled to Italy and Greece for one week each, other than some of few
short trips. You will find them in pictures for 2004.

In the month of November we framed few pictures and cross-stitch work of
Pamela. Here are the pictures of the same. The two flower pictures are
from Keukenhof trip. This is the first time we enlarged our pictures for
framing.
