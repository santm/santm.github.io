Well my French classes came to an end. And I passed the exam :D I would
like to take up the Oscar podium for few seconds and like to thank my
beloved wife Pamela for her support ; my teacher, my colleagues- Stephan
and Fred for their time and effort to make me understand the basics of
French grammar. And I am very satisfied that I didn't let them down as I
scored well in grammar and got all the **Pass√©-compose** and
**Imparfait** (past tense) correct.

Well, this could not have been enjoyed more without going to the same
bar where last time we went from the class before Christmas break.
