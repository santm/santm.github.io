There were massive bomb blasts last summer in Mumbai local trains. After
that now there are constant reminders for the commuters to be on alert
and check their surroundings. It is logistical nightmare to manage the
massive number of commuters who takes train every day in Mumbai. In
simple words, “impossible” will be closest word I can pick.

Few months back after lots of planning and public announcement Mumbai
Police conducted a security drill where every passenger was supposed to
pass via metal detector in two Main Terminus in the evening but after
few moments it was clear that police can not handle the stream of
passengers in lakhs and crores as they were heading home and it was
abandoned. The good news is that it is indeed possible to check if the
need arises but impossible on regular basis.

Although, there is always one or two man in khaki uniform in each
station. But those people physically look so unfit with their bulging
waistline that I personally do not feel any safe with them. Its just a
game of probability in Mumbai terrorist attack. If you happen to be at
Mumbai in the wrong time at wrong place you are in danger. No one can
save you in Mumbai as it runs by “Bhai” (common con for the Bhai). There
is always a strong nexus between underworlds with every business that
flourishes at Mumbai. Be it movie making, real estate, jewelry --- just
name it.

So till next time Mumbai rocks again – safe and happy commuting –
Mumbaians.
