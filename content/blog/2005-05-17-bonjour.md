After a long time I changed the theme of my web site; hope the color
combination looks good. The two templates are 'new' and 'zen'.

There are now more than 1300 pictures to checkout in the Photo Album
section. Most of them come from last 3 years as that is how old my
digital camera is. And a big section comes from Europe. After moving to
Paris, we used this opportunity to visit maximum countries possible
which are part of Schengen visa.

This year we went to Germany, Austria, Spain and Portugal till far.

Though, each countries and places have own attractions. But now, it
looks all alike .. **Chateau, Bateau, Gateau (Castle, Boat Ride,
Dessert)** along with Museums and Cathedrals. May be this is due to too
many places we have visited in last 2 years.

I recently played with Ming a cool system to play with PHP for creating
Flash movies. Here is sample Ming, PHP slideshow . Also created a simple
banner with [typewriter (ticker)
effect](http://blog.santm.com/2005/11/create-typewriter-effect-with-ming-php.html)
