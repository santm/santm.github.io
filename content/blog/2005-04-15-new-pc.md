After months of checking web sites for prices reading forums for review
and always thinking about moving out Paris I got my new PC. It was not
an easy choice as all these years I wanted a Mac from Apple. And
Mini-Mac was a real contender for long time.

  

But at the end I went for mini-PC because of the money and choice of
flexibility I have with the same. There has been a tremendous change in
computer hardware in terms of speed, functionality and size in last 4
years when I made last PC. This is the configuration I got for my new
PC.

-   Shuttle SB83G5
-   INTEL Pentium 4 530J 3.0 GHz
-   Samsung PC3200 512Mo DDR
-   Hitachi 160Go 7200 RPM S-ATA 7K250
-   LiteOn 48/24/48(CD) & 16x (DVD)

  

It coasted me around 650 Euros when I got these parts from different
small computer stores in Rue-Montgallet in Paris. Well I have to admit
the whole setup process was quite easy but it requited a good amount
reading the manual. It worth the RTFM as the CPU and heat sink
connection is the most vital and tricky for a success.
