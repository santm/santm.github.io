Last Saturday, it was father & son time again as Pamela in school after
a long summer vacation. Aarush was doing his part to keep my hands busy
and asked him are you a Nut for being such naughty? And the apt reply
was “***Yes, I am; I am a coconut***”. I could not stop laughing for a
long time. Even though we call it a nut but coconut is not a nut
botanically?
