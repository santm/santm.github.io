 Pinakthon is a initiative to encourage todays women of India to
participate in active life style. Being  little active myself I know it
is very difficult for modern urban Indian women to follow the same.
There are many logistical issues staring from family, in-laws, sons,
daughters, job and what not.  
  
But the biggest block I think is they themselves as to take initiative
of starting an active lifestyle and being committed to it which is not
an easy commitment . Though I am not expecting them to run Full-Marathon
in sub 3 hours but even if they can do atleast 30 minutes of speed walk
or other cardiac activities on daily basis that would be great.
