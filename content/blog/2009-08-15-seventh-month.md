Being uncertain about travel plans ahead we got his passport ready in
hurry-burry where my darling posed in front of camera without much
hesitation.

He can balance to sit unsupported but for short time while leaning
forward and spreading his legs out wide and straight for support. He
started to recognize people. On calling his name from back he use to
turn around to find where sounds come from. Want to explore by putting
A-Z thing to his mouth. Moving around on all fours is not yet perfect
wriggles forward sometimes on the stomach. He doesn't likes to be left
alone in the room.

Maids another headache in India... one just left without any prior
notice. I was so depressed with pressure mounting on me as on one side
taking care of Aarush along with all house-hold stuffs and on other side
my mom-in-law was coming like expecting too much out of me at same time.
A satisfactory maid is so difficult to get....I am planning to write a
book on them.

when you are a mother, you are never really alone in your thoughts.Â A
mother always has to think twice, once for herself and once for her
child.

His grandma (thamma) came. He use to spend with her 2 hrs at morning
while I finished cooking. Our baby coos, gurgles while looking at
interesting things or when talked to and yells for attention. One of his
uncle too came around this time; he [played
mouthorgan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkc-pBlV3CI "Mouth Organ by Jeet -- Aarush")
which he enjoyed while trying to be in seating position.

  

Now he likes to listen to rhymes while eating. As soon as it is switched
on he use to look at TV set. He doesn't mind repeating them.

He has started to tear paper pages into pieces then tries to chew them.
So we got sturdy board books which he looks for a while and then throw
or drop them as he can't chew anymore. He spends more time with book in
his mouth than in their hands. Once we tried him in shoulder sling he
was unimaginably happy. Seeing him it made me laugh loud as if baby
kangaroo is snugged to mom. And he in turn seeing me laughing, laughed
for first time....really amazing as if he understood. Now he is getting
more vocal and expressive.
