Summer of 2002 was a great summer. I did lots of travelling. Thanks toTanujoy and Atul for the same. With Atul and I went to Utah for 4 daytrip in July, it was just great!. We visited four national parks andtravelled through very scenic highways.
I went to Yosemite few times for hiking and climbing with members of[PGVIP](http://www.pgvip.net) and with other friends as well.
