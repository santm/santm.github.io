Looking at those plastic chairs brought back my memories of
[**Anandamela**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anandamela) (a Bengali
children magazine - published fortnight. They used to have picture of
common objects in obscure way and you have to identify the same. I know
this picture is a far cry from those -any way some sweet memories to
reflect upon from fourth floor while taking this picture.

In India celebration is part of life whether big or small ones. But not
like west, where you have *Christmas as the main one*. Here some
community celebrates one festival in a BIG way while others something
else. You are always between BIG parties of communities. You can not
miss them - the reason is very simple … **bright choice of colors**
which catches your attention even if you don’t want which is once again
different from west where black and white and sometimes red is primary
colour of their clothing.

  

Similarly, there are some big or small events at work also; not as fancy
as of those year-end parties I attended abroad. As Indian economies and
companies enjoy the **Bull Run** these celebrations got few extra
feathers on their wings.

These two pictures were taken at PCP, ([Peninsula Corporate
Park](http://wikimapia.org/739919/)) lower Parel. This used to be a big
cotton mill before. Cotton Mills were moved out of Mumbai in 70ties
after the long and famous strike by Shakti-Samanth. Now all those mills
area are getting converted into posh malls, offices or residential
apartments.

If I am not wrong it was party thrown out by
[**Diageo**](http://www.diageo.com/) – the big liquor company (Johnny
Walker, Smirnoff and other big labels).
