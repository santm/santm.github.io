The first trip to France countryside was to Cantal -central region for 3
days with Murali & Joydeep on July 14th. Cantal, in France's Massif
Central, is the largest volcanic edifice in Europe. We went by car,
Murali did a wonderful job by seating at the back of steering wheel &
Joydeep at navigator’s seat while we two were enjoying sleeping (from
time to time) at back seat. We enjoyed a natural landscape which was
really worth seeing through own eyes- rolling hills, lush green
farmlands, small mountains, forests & valleys.

  

We went to this trip for hiking but unfortunately we couldn’t as it was
extreme sultry weather to do so. We tried to do in one of the mountain
but after halfway we gave up because of strong sun overhead made it
unbearable.The night stay at hotel (run by family) was excellent as they
speak quite good English, there hospitality were excellent & food too
was home made so of course delicious (5 course French dinner).

  

We went to Grandval Lake over which is constructed Bridge by Gustave
Eiffel 584M in length. This metal bridge with only one parabolic arc was
able to support the weight of the trains, resist hard and powerful
transverse winds for years although now train doesn’t run over this
bridge. Near to this bridge was one restaurant where we had our dinner.
Here, for first time we had Confit de canard (duck) which was delicious
and had mouth watering dessert at the end.

  

Day after we reached Paris at afternoon as we changed our plan because
of strong heat wave. On reaching Paris we had Japanese lunch near to
Luxembourg gardens.
