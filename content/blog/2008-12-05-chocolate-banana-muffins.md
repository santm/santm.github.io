First weekend of December past with lots of activities - a trip to
commercial street, malls and office. On Saturday Aarush forced me to
leave bed early - deprived me of extended sleeping on the weekend. After
that I was busy with him mostly for breakfast. Nowadays he has developed
a nasty habit of prolonged (around an hour or more) eating times be it
breakfast, lunch or dinner. After that he played for while but soon he
was sleepy for nap. That created an opportunity for me to try muffin
which was long time overdue.

I searched quickly for “chocolate banana muffin” recipe and found [this
one](http://www.taste.com.au/recipes/15298/choc+chip+banana+muffins) and
went with it as it looked simple and easy except few changes. I beated
powdered sugar with melted butter first. In between I kept two eggs
outside of freeze to bring them to room temperature. Mixed one tea-
spoon of leveled baking soda and baking power each in the flour and
sieved 3-4 times to make sure there is enough air mixed in the flour.
Then I whisked the eggs and added milk to it; after mashing banana in
the grinder I mixed all three together.

Now kept adding half of the dry and liquid ingredients alternatively to
the sugar - butter mixture. Lastly, stir in chocolate.

With that my job was almost over as soon as I put the tray for baking;
to my surprise and delight they started to rise nicely. Best part of the
whole exercise was quick yet successful result. It only took 40 mins to
prepare and clean up the kitchen. It might take much less if you are
prepared as of my case it was all impromptu right from searching recipe
to oven. Anywayz, after a long time enjoyed my time in kitchen – thanks
to Aarush for his nap :)

> P.S. May add little bit more sugar if you prefer muffin sweet.
