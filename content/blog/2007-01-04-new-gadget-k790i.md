Well I got
[it](http://blog.santm.com/2006/08/04/swiss-map-tgv-and-gizmo/). After
lots of deliberation I upgraded my choice to K790 from K750. The big
difference is price and features to say in simple words. I heard in
recent time James Bond used this same phone in his [last
movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381061/). Not sure what all other
accessories [**Mr.Q**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(James_Bond))
added for him on the film.

I wanted to buy a camera phone as that will be handy to capture events.
I remember spending $250 in [Fry’s](http://frys.com/) for Handspring
Camera module in 2002. Oh! That looks like dinosaurs in comparison now.

Here are some pictures from the camera. The first one is of GPO(General
Post Office) Mumbai; I was amazed when I went there first time. It is a
true heritage from British time in Indian history. Unfortunately, it
could have been better maintained like a heritage site. The design of
“centenary hall” is so European with big round center desk.

The next picture is of the newspaper stand near my office. Well, a
contrast from [Pamela’s
picture](http://www.santm.com/gallery3/index.php/paris/monuments/presse)
Paris news-paper stand. ;)

Back to my phone I just want to make a note to future/current owner to
use [MyPhoneExplorer](http://www.fjsoft.at/en/) a freeware to sync. You
can sync with [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/thunderbird/)
for your address book - not being stuck with M$. Still waiting from
Hutch customer support for a simple MMS settings to be downloaded on my
phone so that I can access internet and other cool features; according
to their SLA it might takeup to 72 hours and I am still waiting :(
