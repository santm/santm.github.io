Staying at Sachin’s place at Zurich was just to save our 3 night’s hotel
expense. After lot of discussion & surfing internet we came to final
decision that on 4th day of our trip we will go to [Mount
Titlis](http://www.titlis.ch/ "Mount Titlis") via Luzern in order to
make best use of our Swiss flexi pass.  
  

On boarding the train from Luzern to Engelberg we realized that it’s
more of Desi train. From train station, routes are well marked for
heading towards Mount Titlis where one can see all Mr. & Mrs. Desi with
family. There are few other Asian visitors also but they were well out
numbered… thanks to our Hindi movie director who made our recent
heroines dance in the valleys & snows of Switzerland.

There is even a small Indian take away restaurant at foot of mountain
next to the ticket office. Check

here. The number of Indian visitors has so much effect on Mount Titlis
that you will find signs in Hindi along with other international
languages and even there is “Indian Specialties” waiting for you at the
top.  
  

There are three cable cars that take you to the top of Titlis via four
sections. The last section is in a world’s first rotating cable car. The
top is at 10000 ft with glacier all around. We took a ski chair lift
(Ice Flyer) to reach Snow Park where one can enjoy snow in the month of
June.

The weather in the mountains is always unpredictable. It was a sudden
change in the weather, while going up it was very sunny with blue sky
and later it became dark. After spending an hour it started to drizzle
so we thought it might be better idea to come down to Engelberg.  
  

We had our “take away” lunch in the center park near to the railway
station. On our way back from Engelberg it was a heavy down pour all the
way to Luzern. But nothing stops our spirit, on reaching Luzern we
strolled around the old town of Luzern.
