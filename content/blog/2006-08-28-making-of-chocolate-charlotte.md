Today we have a dinner invitation; spent whole yesterday morning in
thinking what would be good to prepare as I did not want to buy anything
from supermarket. Since we are moving, wanted to clean the fridge
without overstuffing it. So after lot of thought came to conclusion that
charlotte might be best. Learnt this recipe from a friend.

  
A **charlotte** is any dessert that's moulded into a container lined
with sponge fingers or boudoir biscuits (purchased at a bakery or
supermarket). Itâ€™s normally easy to prepare; hardly takes 15 min.

  

  
Make the syrup by mixing equal amount of sugar and water flavour it with
adding same amount of rum or brandy to taste.

  
First line the bottom as well as sides of a container with clean wrap &
then with sponge fingers soaked in sugary alcoholic syrup. Now layer it
alternatively with **chocolate mouss**e and sponge fingers in a way that
top layer should be covered with sponge fingers. Then cover with clean
wrap tightly and lid. Leave it to chill for more then 12 hours.

  
To serve, invert dish onto serving plate and unmold charlotte. Carefully
remove plastic wrap. (Variation can be done using **vanilla mousse &
chocolate mousse** alternatively). While serving dust with icing sugar
and decorate with fruits or with cold custard or whipped cream.

Well, had our dinner in one Thai restaurant where we had **duck in red
curry coconut sauce** and **red curry chicken** along with **shrimps in
green curry basil sauce**. What gives Thai food its distinctive
character is a harmony in its tastes - sour, salty, hot and aromatic.
Mmmm....delicious!
