These people in red shirts are commonly known as **“coolie”** or porters
who are commonly seen at Indian Railway Station. They remind me of those
childhood days when they were part of our vacation *(mass aviation is
still in infancy at India)*. They help to carry big over sized luggage
that Indian travelers travel with. As Indian travelers are not that
physically fit like westerners to lift their own luggage. Coolies are
not permanent employee of railways but have a long and strong working
relation with them. They get lots of benefits from railways like
medical, schooling for their kids and etc. Their recruitment process is
very complex and I am not an expert to write on details. What I know is
their badges can be transferred between family members and the
definition of family members is very vague. This often results in badge
being auctioned between **5,00,000 to 20,00,000 INR( 10K-40K USD)**.

Their working wage according to railway rule book is very minimal;
through which they will not be able to sustain themselves or their
family. So there is little bit of negotiations between coolie and
travelers. Most of the time they are like moving timetable of Indian
railways, you can cross check for platform number, coach position for
your train and they will guide you to the right place at right time.

Going down the memory lane there is a famous [Mohmohan Desai's
movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085361/) by same name acted by none
other but **Amitabh Bachan** in Hindi at 80s. The movie is very close to
Bachan fans as he had a near death situation while performing a stunt
for this. Whole India was gripped by this news and the movie release was
eagerly anticipated by his fans.
