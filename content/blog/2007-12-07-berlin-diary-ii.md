Freshened up to kick start our day and decided to go through past of
Germany. Took metro and got off at Potsdamer platz. Had coffee at
Starbucks just outside the metro exit as it was too cold.

From here we walked to **Checkpoint Charlie** - a crossing point between
East and West Germany during the Cold War and **Berlin Wall Memorial**.
The scenes blur as present dissolves into the past. Images flash through
our mind of 1989 when news flashed with headlines of demolition of
Berlin wall. The wall no longer divides east and west instead the city
straddles past and future.

As this is close to **Friedrichstrasse** known for upmarket shopping
area like Lafayette; strolled there on our return towards metro station
of postdamer platz we visited Helmut john’s Sony centre - skyline is a
mixture of buildings marked by WWII shrapnel and glass-steel giants - a
symbol of new Berlin office-cum–shopping centre.

In Berlin, the past is everywhere like **Gendarmenmarkt** - a classical
square in Berlin whose name dates back when city was occupied by
Napoleon. This square is bordered by two **cathedrals** - the *French
Cathedral* and *German Cathedral* with *Konzerthaus* (Concert Hall) -
home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra between the two cathedrals.

Then we visited darling of berlin - bust of **Nefertiti** which was
adorned at the Exhibition Hall of Kulturforum (culture forum - This
museum often houses temporary exhibitions during which the permanent
collection is usually not on display) near to Potsdamer Platz as
Egyptian museum was closed.

On way to Brandenburg we went to see **Siegessäule** (Victory Column)
close to Tiergarten which stands in centre where five roads meet.

  

After having late light meal, we once again set off to see the past
which expresses the euphoria and great hopes for a better future for all
people of the world. This city’s divider was also the world’s longest
canvas that stretched for miles covered with **graffiti** painted on
**east side** - *open air Gallery close to station Ostbahnhof*.

Came back to Zoologischer Garten took some night mode shots of Kaiser
Wilhelm church and after all sight seeing it was time to eat; had
awesome *Portuguese* dinner at one small restaurant nearby and then
headed towards our hotel.
