Today we got up pretty late compared to other days. Had breakfast and
left the hotel around 9 AM. There are some journeys in life which are
hard to forget. Our trek to the much talked about Double Decker Root
Bridge was one such journey for me. Staying at Cheerapunji holiday
resort has one advantage that it is hardly 7 km away from double-decker
root bridge. We went 5 KM till Tyrna village where we parked our car and
then 3KMs of hiking we were told by hotel people. When we asked for a
guide they said it's not required, moreover its all marked and proper
cemented pathway so no chance of getting lost.

  

It was a 3500 step journey down the hill. After almost 40 minutes we
reached a small village which we thought was the village with the
bridge, but it was another 40 min from there. At this point, we saw a
very small board nailed to a tree indicating the way to the longest root
bridge. We were only people there still we wanted to cross that bridge
but it shakes and swings and the water flowing 20-25 feet below makes
the whole experience breathtaking. I took the courage first to cross but
half away, came back felt like can’t cross, then Aarush said mamma, are
you scared...let me go. Then his dad stopped him saying let me go, once
I reach another end then you come. Aarush agreed to the same. But
halfway through even Santanu came back saying does not look to be safe
enough to cross. Then after few photo shoots we returned to a regular
path and now the descend was further steep.

After descending few steps, we came across two hanging bridges over
rivers. The bridges were made of rusty iron cables repaired and
supported with bamboo with some parts held together with steel wires.
The whole bridge shakes and swings and the water flowing 20-25 feet
below makes the whole experience scary though adventurous. There were 2
families after us...we allowed them to cross the bridge first. While
crossing the bridge all we could hear were the sounds of the squeaking
cables and gurgling water flowing down the huge rocks, makes the whole
experience nerve-wracking.

  

After a few more climbing up and down the steps, we reached the new
bridge which looks to be recently done. Further few meters ahead was
Nongriat village, where they sell some basic food items, juice, water.
To reach the double-decker bridge, you have to take a few more steps up
– and there it was …

  

This bridge is unique in so many ways. It has been built using the roots
of a tree – that’s still alive. It took years to build this bridge –
patiently waiting for the roots to be guided over and across the river
until it was firm enough to carry weight. Currently, there are two
levels of roots that have been guided across, stacked on top of other.
These are roots from the rubber tree, which is considered to be 200 yrs
old.

  

On reaching there, waterfall from the rocks is so soothing and cool that
feel like jumping into the water which we did not but definitely soaked
my feet in them. Took a few pictures, and spent some time admiring
nature's beauty. From here we went towards natural swimming pool asking
few villagers on the way. We went further up and down the steps but at
one point we were clueless as there was no proper demarcation and that
bridge ends abruptly giving no hint for a natural swimming pool. So,
after that point, we had to return as there was none to guide further
and thus we started our return journey.

  

We again now crossed the double-decker bridge and to my surprise, there
was a guest house with minimum facilities for Rs.400/ per day which I
came to know on asking one foreigner descending from one corner. On our
return, we had some juices to hydrate ourselves while Aarush had proper
basic food without any fuss.

  

We started our climb back to Tyrna again through the swinging bridges
and those steps. But it did take much more time and effort as though
looking at the steep steps. I particularly huffed and puffed to reach
the top and in between, it started raining like cats and dogs for few
mins. One side it rained and another side we were sweating like pig from
head to toe. Felt like they should have one waterfall at the top too so
that one can shower there.
