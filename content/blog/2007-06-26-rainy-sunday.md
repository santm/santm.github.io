This picture was taken from my phone camera when I went to do our weekly
vegetable shopping in APMC \[Agro Product Market\] close to Vashi.
Prices for every vegetables went up. Due to lack of infrastructure it
was a shame to see so much wastage due to heavy rain. From the posture
of the seller it was quite clear he was not looking for lot of customers
as he stretches his back. There are protest against big retail chains as
they started selling Agro products in India. Although, with the entry of
big retail players it will take away lively hood of lots of small
businessmen and prices will shoot up but may be with time they will help
us in saving the products from calamity like this with better
infrastructure.
