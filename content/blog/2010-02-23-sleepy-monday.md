Monday morning mother-son woke up pretty late. Santanu already left for
office while we were in sleep. Around noon we went out of hotel to
nearby mall. Today I was not much interested in exploring rather looking
for kids activities. Spent almost half day at **Toys R Us** play area in
**Paragon** mall where Aarush enjoyed to fullest. He did not want to
give-up the car and was seating there for hours. He was not interested
in playing with slide,swing and all. In fact he was bit scared when I
put him up there. From there went to Carrefour to get some food for him.
Around 4.30 PM came back had shower and both took a beauty sleep. In the
evening Santanu had phone call to attend so after that we went to food
court of Takashimaya for Dinner.

Had noodles and killed time sitting at one corner of pavement as Santanu
had another call to attend.Very uneventful day. Came back and went to
deep sleep again.
