Trip to Goa was long due may-be you can say from 2001 when I got
opportunity as a teacher with my school children. But unfortunately, I
couldn’t make as I was supposed to behave as good girl. Good unmarried
Indian girls don’t go anywhere without an escort. To qualify as an
escort there are lots of criteria to be checked and considered like
friend’s brother, acquaintance from neighborhood etc. is a **BIG NO**.
They never go out after dark alone. They never spent night at a female
friend's place, especially if the friend had a brother no matter younger
or elder.

Dialogues like *“I am old enough to take care of myself”* never worked
with my parents - you can say kind of very conservative upbringing in
certain matters. And it was normal for me to argue on all such matters
though consequences were known to me. So, out of anger I told my parents
*“you will never go to GOA without me or unless I go there first”*. They
kept their words though they travel extensively within India.

On Satanu’s part he visited Goa for first time with his parents in 2002
summer. They went to visit their relatives. He detested the heat and did
not found Goa as an attractive tourist destination. That was the time
when we first met at Bombay after his Goa trip. After moving to India
whenever Goa came in our discussion as destination fear of glazing sun
hunted him.

As Santanu is blessed with long weekends (Indian holidays follow strict
Sun or Moon Calendar) at work this year. We booked our flight with
**Spice-Jet** which was only no-frill flight quoting less. Initially, we
did booked our hotel with Hotel Mandavi at Panjim. But later came to
know from various sources that if one wants to enjoy beaches then need
to make choice between north and south Goa beach. We opted for north Goa
at last minute and booked with **TICLO** resort at Calangute.

Different people had different views on Calangute which made us bit
skeptical till last but I think we did made a right choice. Normally,
hotels provide with “pick-up” service at Goa. On reaching Dabolim
airport we realised our hotel haven’t sent any and they requested to use
“Pre-paid service” which they will reimburse on reaching and they did
stick to their words.

After being ushered to our room which was quite spacious we left for
exploring Calangute. We soon figured out that we were not very far from
beach so walked few meters along the beach at early evening then had
pomfret and chicken in our dinner.
