I just found out d-atmosphere.com is holding a competition where they
are offering a free wordpress theme called [WP
Remix](http://www.wpremix.com/home/). Itâ€™s a very nice theme with loads
of features.

The rule is simple - just write about the competition in your blog and
post your link back in the comments on the contest page.

The winner will be announced on March 1st.
