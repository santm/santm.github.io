Well this post is a dark one-

**Aaj fir dil hai kuchh udaas udaasjaane kyun ek mayusi si chhayi haiaaj
fir palkon pe pani haibheer mein hoon fir kyun ye tanhai hai jaane kyun
bebas aur beychain hai dil mera...**.

In simple words, things around me are going crazy.... restless mind as
there are loved ones who are dealing with the PROBLEM on the ground with
hard reality; facing it more harsh then me who is being updated with
phone calls only.

Anyway, recently I came across one site which tells about sleeping. I
assume you all must be knowing about good effects of sleeping. According
to the [sleep test](http://www.sleepnet.com/sleeptest.html)

**I show symptoms of sleep apnea, a potentially serious sleep
disorder.**

Then I took another [online
test](http://www.dbsalliance.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_depressionscreener)
â€“ and the results is

**Might have moderate depression**

Well that is all ;I feel good now as I hit the "publish" button
