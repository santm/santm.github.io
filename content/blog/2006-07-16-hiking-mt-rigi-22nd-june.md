### Queen of Swiss Mountains

From Zurich we went to Mt. Rigi via Arth-Goldau a very short train ride.
From there we took the cogwheel train to the summit at Rigi-Kulm
(1,800m). Incredible vistas, typical Swiss farmhouses, and hundreds of
cows with bells will surprise one throughout the trip. Reward on going
to top is magnificent panorama of Alpine peaks crowding around the
convoluted contours of Lake Lucerne. While going up it was a nice
weather but slowly & slowly it started getting dark. On a clear day it
seems one can see Mount Titlis.  
  

Perhaps the most glorious hike I’ve enjoyed in Switzerland is from Rigi
Kulm to Vitznau. This trail is not listed in the guide map. But we
wanted to reach Vitzanu to take ferry to Luzern. As we did not wanted to
spent any more money on those special Swiss mountain cog-wheel train.
The trail is well defined. I believe most people prefer to hike up but
it was just opposite in our case. The first part till Rigi Kaltbad
(1438m) is easy. After that, steepness of down hill increased as we came
down with a view of Lake Luzern from time to time.

With greenery all around & Swiss cows wearing engraved and embroidered
cowbells; the lazy grazing of the placid beasts sends a tinkling melody
rippling across the clear mountain air. Serenity all the way far from
those hustle –bustle busy life of city is something worth. Lake
stretching all the way on one side and while on other is Europe’s
greatest mountains. Believe me, now I understand what it means to have
hiking poles as at the end of this hike I almost killed two of my legs.
After that I lost my normal walking style for next few days.

On reaching Vitznau we had our afternoon meal. We boarded a ferry and
enjoyed the lovely boat ride to Luzern (one hour). Time at leisure,
visited the city’s main sights of the Old Town, like the famous Chapel
Bridge which is a main touristy sight of the city. After visiting top
sights of the city we returned to Zurich for one last time.
