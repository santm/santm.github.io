OK, we moved to our own apartment after all. This whole week was very
busy and hectic.Monday: It started with getting informed that my
checkout from hotel was the very same day. But I was not informed about
this before. And hotel people informed Pamela and disconnected
telephone; a real mess. We could not connect each other and convey what
was happening at two ends. I must have to admit the HR practice is worse
here.YES, it is the worst. I didn't have so bad HR even when I was in a
contracting company. May be these HR people feel like they have done a
great favour by hiring you. So I told I am not going to move out from
hotel if needed I will pay from my pocket and wait till the delivery of
my shipment from US is done. So after heated arguments they say oh!! No
problem how many days you want to stay more ....Tuesday/Wednesday: I
took two days off from work. I think I should have given time off to get
settle in my apartment. Any way the movers came on time and really
worked hard to make the delivery at 3rd floor without lift. I realized
the sofa is too.. big for my place and I still wonder how I am going to
get rid of this big and heavy stuff. Lots of box to open and arrange and
we are trying our best. I must admit Pamela did a great job. In mean
time we went to get curtains and other needs from nearby stores.After,
all these I still realize the weekends needs lots of work.Weekends,
started with Darty - the Electronic super store here to order freeze,
washing machine etc and we ended up going to IKEA on Sunday for some
small furnitures.
