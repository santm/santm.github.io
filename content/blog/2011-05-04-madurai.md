Started very early morning around 5.45 from our parking lot and with one
stop at A2B restaurant at Krishnagiri reached Madurai exactly by
11.30AM. Then took some time to find out decent hotel two friends
recommended [“Royal
Court”](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g297677-d617934-Reviews-Royal_Court-Madurai_Tamil_Nadu.html)
near Madurai railway station. The hotel is clean and neat the management
was great to upgrade our room to executive suite as the original room
smelt cigarettes.

After settling we had a vegetarian south Indian lunch at market area.
Then after taking a well deserved afternoon siesta we went to so called
religious hotspot – Meenakshi Temple. It has four entrances we entered
via South gate after leaving our shoes with the temple authorized shoe
stand. The shops near the gates also offer to keep your shops but they
expect you buy something from them in return. Best thing is the city
municipality have golf carts to take you around to any of four gates
your wish to enter. Like Tirupati they have fast track system where if
you buy costly ticket and can bypass some queue. Santanu preferred to go
by general path as crowd was not much. Within two hours we were done.
Would like you to go through more details of [Meenakshi Temple this
website](http://travel.paintedstork.com/blog/2008/05/madurai-meenakshi-temple-i.html)
is quite useful. The writer has well explained about temple interiors.

By 7.30 PM we were done and were just about to return it rained heavily
all of sudden almost stopping everything that whole street was full of
water because of poor drainage. Being one way road it was bit difficult
to walk of our own and we got into one cycle-rickshaw to go back to
hotel. But the rickshaw driver had to stop as rain was too heavy; it
brought a great relief from the humidity and heat. Had dinner around
9.00PM at hotel as Santanu got some food packed from a near by [Anna
Meenakshi
Restaurant](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g297677-d1197241-Reviews-Anna_Meenakshi_Restaurant-Madurai_Tamil_Nadu.html)
and then went to bed early.
