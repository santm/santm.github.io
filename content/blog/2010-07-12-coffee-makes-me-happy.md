My addiction to coffee is not new and there are [few
posts](http://blog.santm.com/tag/coffee "Coffee ") on the same subject
in past. The culture of having a good time with a cup of coffee is
catching up in India. **Café Coffee Day** aka **CCD** is expanding its
footprints in rapid speed from past few years; people close to the
business speculate they are just spending money and expanding in hope
for a bought over by some FDI like **Starbucks** if the later enter
Indian market.

Personally prefer **Barista** (inside Leela hotel more presice) more for
the ambiance then the coffee. This chain has changed ownership a few
times and their service is not consistent across franchises. The
croissant I had in Mumbai airport last Wednesday felt like chewing
gum.Now there are few entries to the market like
**[Cuppa](http://www.cuppastop.com/ "Cuppa in India"),
[Costa](http://www.costacoffee.com/ "Costa ")**. Went to **Cuppa**(in
Benarghata road) few months back after dinner with friends and were
quite disappointed as they did not had any wine that we asked. Felt like
they wanted to push some open bottled wine and my experience with coffee
was not great either. Last Tuesday while in Mumbai went to **Costa**
coffee for the first time and I must admit their coffee was really
great. The price is bit higher from CCD but very much like Barista now
need to see if they can hold on to the quality as they expand within
India.
