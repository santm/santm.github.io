December 1st 2008- World AIDS Day - today, AIDS is one of the main
causes of mortality on the planet. 33 million people are HIV-positive in
the world, but 90 % of them ignore it. Given the numbers, there is a
definite need to increase the awareness levels about the disastrous
effects of this incurable disease.

I am sure there are plenty online about the same which can be accessed
quickly but the main problem remains in uneducated rural areas where it
is not even mentioned forget about a healthy discussion.
