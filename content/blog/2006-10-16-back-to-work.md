Well after one and half months of vacation I am back to work today.
Surprisingly, I will be still using my old e-mail (work) well it does
not mean that I am checking my work mails as I write this post. It will
take sometime for the IT guys before they transfer me electronically
from Europe to Asia. I thought it might be a good time to write
something for the blog.

There has been some progress in terms of settling in Bombay at our own
flat but there is long-long road ahead. There are few positive updates
but a long uphill battle to fight.

I hope both us are going to update the web-site in terms of photos and
posts more often from now on. There is a long list to write about as
there were events which brought smile and worries (most of the time)
often as we look at them through a western point of view.

As I write this post the power went out so all I can see around me is
glowing screens of computers. Welcome to India ;)
