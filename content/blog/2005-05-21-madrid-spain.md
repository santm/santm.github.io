We were on our way to spring break; we planned to visit Spain and Lisbon
for 10 days. We started our trip with flight from Paris to Madrid on
Saturday 21st May 2005.

  

We reached Charles de Gaulle Airport on time and the checking was smooth
but after boarding the plane we were in ground for almost one hour
before taking off. The cost cutting measures with European state
carriers are all alike now, so there is no free snacks & drinks in the
short flight. By the time we reached Madrid in the afternoon we were
very hungry. We got into the Metro from Airport to our Hotel which
involved dragging our luggage for 10 minutes or so. The hotel was again
‘Novotel’, this one was not that outside one like that of Vienna but not
very close to the Metro like Berlin. But we found this one is quite OK
with public transportation as there is a Bus stop just outside the hotel
which takes to the center of Madrid – Sol.

  

After freshen up we headed towards Sol, after reaching there we had a
very late lunch in a Falafel place. It was great – cheap price – tasty
and fresh food.

  

After that we started our walk tour towards Royal Palace via Plaza
Mayor. This walk is a kind of an introductory tour referred in any
travel guide book. We took lot of pictures of the beautiful ceiling of
the royal church, decorated with bright colors. From there we headed
more south towards the Basilic.

  

![](../images/2005-05-21-madrid-spain-madrid.jpg)Our dinner was not
up-to mark. As dining section of Rick Steve's guide book is quite empty.
There are plenty to choose from when it comes to eating as Spaniards
have great passion about gastronomy.After dinner we walked from Sol
towards East to “Banco de Espana” and we tried to capture few nice big
white buildings in night mode with tripod.

  

Next day morning we checked out from hotel and started our Bus journey
to Granada. We were very lucky to get to the bus station on time to
board the bus to Granada with out any wait. The five and half hour long
smooth & comfortable ride with one break gave us view of Spain’s
agricultural rich country side. Before reaching Granada we passed some
scenic view of Sierra Nevada range.
