As we were leaving Paris it seems our friends (whom we knew for a short
while) has to give something as a memento. Gifts were extravagant and
really worth mentioning as they chose something which we adore.

  
To start with gift Pamela got from François is very special. I am sure
she can write a new post about the same. I am just going to give you
brief detail on the same.

  
It is stitching project (cross-stitch) with 290 x 359 stitches using 70
color threads. François not only gave the design print-out along with
instructions but also got the black piece of cloth which is not that
easily available in the market.

  
If cross-stitch is not your cup of tea and you prefer coffee like me.
Check her [project to be
started](http://www.goldenkitestore.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=239_206_1_8&products_id=2609)
. It is going to be a very long and difficult project to finish.
Hopefully, Pamela takes enough time as well as break in-between
otherwise it will cost her eyes ;).Not only this, she even got bedside
**lamp** of effiel tower & **salwar-kurta** from two of her close
friends.

And now my turn, gift from my dear colleagues was all about **Paris**
and **Langue Francais**. Best of all I liked the wrapping for the
wonderful [book on photography of
Paris](http://www.amazon.ca/Paris-Lights-%E9dition-anglaise-Tocqueville/dp/2866653734).
I am sure it must have got lots of curious look from others while
getting packed. On the flight there was a nice one page article about
[POST-IT](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/701661.stm) how it was
invented in 3M and how it waited for long time before marketed and sold
to customers. I really can not think my office days without it like
millions others across the globe.

  
Thanks a lot guys if you are reading it !! Well there will be more post
on those last hours ..... keep reading.
