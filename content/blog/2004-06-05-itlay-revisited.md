We have been to Rome for 4 days in 2003 but we wanted to visit the other
parts of Italy but could not do that due to time constrain. We were
planning for trip to Florence, Venice etc old **classic route** for long
time.

**Krovi and Vidya** went to Italy on their paper honeymoon which was 3
weeks earlier than us and they did provided us with lots of good tips.
Then we too spent a lot of time on Internet especially on Rick Steve's
site and talking to other friends about the same.

We found a very good deal on train via SNCF to Milan for to and fro in
1st class which we opted. We booked almost all our hotels via
[venere](http://www.venere.com/) after planning our itinerary.

Our itinerary was:  
**Day1** : Arrive Milan, after check-in leave for Pleasure day-trip to
Lake Como and back to Milan.  
**Day2**: Train to Cinque Terre (hiking to an extraordinary old villages
set in rugged coastal mountains )  
**Day3**: Pisa (Picture stop at the Leaning Tower) and continue further
for Florence  
**Day4**: Day trip to Sienna and back to Florence  
**Day5**: Explore renaissance city Florence  
**Day6**: Half day at Florence and leave for Venice  
**Day7**: Venice at leisure  
**Day8**: Back to Milan and at same night journey to home via rail.
