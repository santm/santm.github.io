Till far only soup ever tried to make was carrot soup in Paris that too
in bleak winter. Big thanks to my **French Teacher** for sharing the
recipe en Français. Recently, went to local vegetable market; seeing
tomato got so tempted that without thinking bought two kilos. Then I
brainstormed a bit to think and idea of soup came as an escape. Here is
my 2 cents recipe. If craving for something **sweet and sour** at the
same time just have a bowl of creamy tomato soup to satisfy your desire
as an appetizer.

-   One kilo Tomato – boiled, peeled and deseeded.
-   Two/three carrots – chopped to tiny pieces.
-   One big Onion finely chopped
-   Few cloves of garlic
-   One red chili
-   One Bay leaf
-   ½ tsp cumin seeds
-   Black pepper
-   Nutmeg
-   2 tbsp Olive oil / ½ tbsp butter
-   Juice from one fresh Orange
-   Low fat cream or thick yoghurt
-   Dried Basil / Parsley leaves - optional
-   Salt to taste

Heat the oil/ butter and fry cumin seeds, bay leaf, garlic and onion
with pinch of salt. When onion turns golden, add carrots and continue
frying at low flame. Once carrot is tender add tomato and fry for few
minutes

Make puree in a grinder (remove bay leaf before). Add water according to
thickness required. Put the blended soup back in the pan. Bring to boil
and cook for 5 minutes on medium heat. Now add freshly squeezed orange
juice and cream after removing from heat. *Season it with nutmeg and
fresh black pepper. Garnish with a couple of parsley or basil sprigs if
any and serve hot with either croutons or bread slice.*

  

Best news is “**Bread-Talk**” boutique has recently opened at Vashi. It
is a famous bakery chain from Singapore and they do cater good quality
of various breads as well as desserts. But sadly, the dessert I got from
there was too creamy, spongy and sugary. I will say tasteless to my
taste buds as these kinds of pastries are very popular throughout India.
After tasting European pastries, I find these one as - concept of
western baked goods mixed with Asian ingenuity makes cool looking
pastries that are hit-and-miss at certain point. While **multi-cereal
bread** which I got was awesome.
