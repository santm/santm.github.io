**Flowers are the sweetest things God ever made and forgot to put a soul
into.** - Henry Ward Beecher.

I don't know really why I love to picture flowers. Wherever visit if
they fascinate me, try to make them my subject.

My dad loves garden; for him it is most sociable of hobbies.Truly said,
the very nature of one's field of activities demands an audience. No one
wants flowers to blush unseen or waste their sweetness. So, every time
we are there we are taken around. This is one of the variety of china
rose although not much redolent from my parents garden. Currently, we
are on a 10days vacation at **Siliguri** to escape humid heat and fast
life of Mumbai. As said, we tried to take lots of pictures this time of
flowers with my new gadget Canon-G7 camera. Just could not stop my self
from posting the same. [**Link to
