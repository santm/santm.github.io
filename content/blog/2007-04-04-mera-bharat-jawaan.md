Another funny advertisement which caught my attention **Budda Hoga Tera
Baap**. This is a soft or hard slang depending on your view - **"May be
your father is old"** This new TV series name is "**Mera Bharat
Jaawan**" which translates into "My India is Young". With one fourth
population under the age of 25 India definitely has young demography.

P.S - In last two months, I have changed theme for wordpress (blog) at
least four times. It either resulted in broken site or broken
functionality. Very happy to see some comments coming in recent time to
our web site. It really boasts moral to keep posting pictures, thoughts
and experiences. In coming weeks, plan to give a new face for the
[front-page](http://www.santm.com/) as we are no longer staying in Paris
and update [Pamela's corner](http://pamela.santm.com/) as well. Cheers
