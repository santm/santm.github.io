style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; white-space: pre-wrap;">We
work up fresh after a good sleep. But soon we realized we are in a place
which we are very not fond off. May be the Mussoorie did not blink with
us. After taking shower and getting ready for the day we went up to the
restaurant for breakfast. But looked like we were an early riser as
there were no one else and the place was not cleaned up for the day. So
we out for a stroll.</span>

breakfast was quick and we cleared our dues and packed our bags. Now
getting the car out was another struggle but with daylight, it was
little it was little easy but still lots of maneuvering. </span>

decided to give Mussorie a complete pass and started for Dehradun. The
downhill journey was quite quick. We thought to cover Indian Forest
Research Institute first. Somehow we could not follow Google Map’s
initial direction so had to go through the city. We saw Ram Krishna
Ashram along the main road itself. </span>

Research Institute is almost 100+ years old Institute set up by the
British to study and preserve diverse forests of India. It is a must
visit for anyone. From Wikipedia </span>

Built on a lush green estate spread over 450 hectares, with the outer
Himalaya forming its back drop, the institute’s main building is an
impressive edifice, marrying </span>[<span

spent a good amount of time to explore the museum and its different
section. It is really vast if you are not a museum person you might get
bored too quickly with so many exhibits and history.</span>

exploring FRI to our heart's content we left for Robber’s cave or
Guchhupani. The road from FRI to Robber’s cave goes via military area.
As we took a wrong turn out of FRI we crossed the main gate of Rashtriya
Indian Military College another imperial legacy. It was on our list but
we could not stop due to high security to take any decent picture of the
building from outside.</span>

parked at Robber’s cave we changed our shoes for Crocs ;). This is a
river cave which has a waterfall (a small one) at the end; almost half a
kilometer long with a narrow passage. The water was low so it was a
pleasant walk in summer but at times crowded.</span>

covering these two attractions we decided to leave Dehradun for Haridwar
post lunch. </span>

had lunch at a kebab place on the Haridwar road.</span>

of the drive to Haridwar was OK. Most roadways was an undivided road
which means we have to be extra careful. We crossed the lone airport of
Uttarakhand which is halfway between Haridwar and Dehradun. As we
approached Haridwar the traffic increased and one or two places it was
snail pace. The last few KM was to our hotel was tricky as we cross the
Ganges and drive through narrow lanes. </span>

one point we made a left turn before and we could see Sadhus wearing
saffron on Royal Enfield bullets coming. We immediately stopped on the
side and could see a big procession coming towards to us and an elephant
leading the gathering. Immediately with a fraction of seconds had turned
the car and headed back from we came. It was one of those escapes you
remember after month while trying to pen down the diary. Soon we were
next to the bus stand and railway station. And our stay was next door.
The hotel was again from GMVN with a huge parking. </span>

time the hotel was much more cleaner compared to last night.  Our room
was big and OK. We freshened up and headed towards famous Ganga Aarti on
a Rickshaw. The journey was like crawling at the end with any rooms with
so many people and narrow lane. </span>

though it was just 5 in the evening we were already late for Ganga
Aarti. All the available place to view the same were taken and we had to
squeeze ourselves. We had to stand separately as I was with camera and
Pamela with Aarush. Lucky for Aarush he found some place to stand to
peep through the crowd.  The crowd and the atmosphere are altogether a
different experience and I do not possess the writing skill or the
photography skill to narrate the same. It is a must watch if you are
traveling to this part of India. The Aarti (evening prayer) is about 40
mins or so long with many small activities in between.</span>

Aarti we stopped for dinner into a restaurant in the very corner. The
food was OK the service was crazy as it was very crowded. We decided to
walk back to our hotel. It was around 2 KM of walking and we opted to
walk using bylanes full of shops rather than the main road which is
always full of honking from bikes.</span>
