Another view of Mumbai's Ballard Pier from my desk. May be I am too busy
between meetings so no time to romance with my valentine. Well, heart
shape balloons floating around our office here and there reminding me of
the special day. Due to meetings and tight schedule I even missed the
chocolate distribution. **C'est dommage!!!** :( . Although enormous
work-pressure but many thoughts are coming across to make evening
better. Let's see if it works or not.
