Our hotel Wild Grass was next to Central Zone. For the second day in
Kaziranga, we supposed to have elephants Safari in the morning. Now
there are 2 places where you can have elephant safari. The central zone
is very popular, is difficult to get, The counter opens at 7 PM in the
evening prior and people line up for long, there is a priority to
foreign tourist. Our hotel arranged for the Western Zone.

 <span style="text-align: justify;">As last evening we already had done
our safari there, we drove in our car till the Western Gate. Reaching
there we called the person who was supposed to make our booking and take
us to Safari. There were hundreds of people in the early morning. We
could not get the first batch of Safari as there are a limited number of
elephants. There were vendors selling hot tea and other hot beverages.
We spotted many birds just outside the Park gate.</span>  

  

These elephant rides take place at the very edge of the Park. There are
only 4 people (max) allowed on each elephant. Depending on the group of
tourists and their overall weight distribution the seating is arranged.
Getting up on the back elephant is always fun, it is shaky and you need
to adjust yourself and your legs properly. The best part of the elephant
ride is it takes you very close to the rhino. The track is partly swap
so you swing a lot from the back of the elephant. Photography is
difficult as there are not many stable moments. The whole ride was for
about 45 minutes.

Post the ride we came back to the hotel, had a big breakfast that
involved freshly cooked many dishes. We walked around the property and
did some photoshoots. And decided to visit the nearby Orchid &
Biodiversity Park.

  

In the afternoon we had our second jeep safari in the central zone. We
again saw many birds, elephants, rhino. It was really great. If you plan
to visit Kaziranga must recommend Wild Grass for their rustic bungalow
with warm hospitality.
