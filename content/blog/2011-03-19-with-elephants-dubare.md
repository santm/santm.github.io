This year we didn't celebrate **Aarush** B'day as we moved to our
own apartment. Being new to complex we hardly knew anyone to invite.So
decided to celebrate his B'day at school which he of-course didn't like
much as he didn't receive any gifts and top of it he has to give return
gifts to his school mates….which he did so with heavy heart.

We decided to  take him to **[Dubare elephant
camp](http://www.junglelodges.com/index.php/resorts/dubare.html)**. We
booked for **jungle lodges**...although bit pricey but worth every penny
of it.  Everything is done on time and there are naturalist for
every [activities](http://www.junglelodges.com/index.php/resorts/dubare.html)
as mentioned on their web site. No doubt, Jungle Lodge rocks as they
pamper with their services and hospitality.  It was unexpectedly cold in
the night for which we were not that well equipped but rest all was too
good. Aarush enjoyed and made frienship with Mehul ; he had good time
there.  We did spotted some deers and small wild animals and
the documentary on Indian Tiger on th evening was too good.

> elephants do potty as they get into water so it was bit unygenic
> feeling which didn’t allow me to give them bath with same enthu.
