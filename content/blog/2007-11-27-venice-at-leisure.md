Next day, when we woke up, were very happy to see blue sky after two
days of grey sky. Around 9.00 AM we came by boat to hot-spot St. Mark's
Square. **St. Mark's Basilica** which is Byzantine influenced was too
crowded to visit that time and unfortunately in evening we ran out of
time and could not make it so satisfied ourselves from outside only.
**Doge's Palace** is a gothic palace with bridge of sighs at rear end
which is made of white limestone and has windows with stone bars. It
connects the old prisons to the interrogation rooms in the Doge's Palace
and last view point of Venice that convicts use to see before their
imprisonment. **Campanile bell tower** is worth for city view only but
we did not take the flight of stairs as we have lot more to explore.
*Visiting museum was big **NO** as we had enough* (time was another
constraint).

  

Did enjoyed trip along the **Grand Canal** with hopping on-off.
Countless bridges lace together the neighborhoods of Venice. Amazed to
see many *historical buildings is slowly sinking* into the marshy
ground…getting tilted?

At afternoon after lunch we took a cruise to one of islands in the
Venetian lagoon. We went to **Murano** where one gets chance to watch
Venetian glass blowers fashion their delicate objects known for
*glassware, lamps, chandeliers and glass jewelry*. We started with glass
museum and visited few glass factories, they show you the art, but for
them it is just part of work. We got few souvenirs for friends and
family.

  

At evening we came back to **Rialto Bridge**. Rialto Bridge is famous
for its shops. There are three bridges joined together which makes it
special. Wandered around saw many taking **gondola ride** – it’s
‘*expensive*’. Best if you are a group of four to split the cost for
those twenty minutes. Any way, we could not found another couple to
share and decided against it. The route from the Rialto to the Academia
(one of the famous museum) and back to piazza San Marco winds through
ornate squares and is quite interesting.

It seems Venice is not the place for pasta. Rather, **Cichetti**
(chee-keht-tee) are small portions of food served in bars all over the
city, with small glass of wine. You eat while standing in a crowded
room. Certain bars display all the Cichetti before you; *Sorry, couldn’t
enjoy that as I am not a wine-lover*.
