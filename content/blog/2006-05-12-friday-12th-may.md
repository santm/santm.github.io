Just another weekend of May in Paris. I don't know any other time when
the weather can be so beautiful with clear sky and warm temperature.
Right now, all the [horse chestnut
trees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse-chestnut) along wide
boulevards are full of white flowers. This tree is also known as
**Marronier d'Inde**, thanks to Francois for introducing the same.
Truly, if one cheers up and forgets all the problems round him-it is a
romantic experience in itself. Today, I am feeling very lucky and
privileged with my jolly mood.

Well this post is not only about Paris, I just found from
Google-analytics that someone linked to our site. It brought a big smile
on my face as he wanted to visit all the places as we did.

  

Today, tried adding my first comment in mysql.com about my experience
with transaction logs. But looks like it did not got added to their
system :(Seems like a weekend is not enough for it :D
