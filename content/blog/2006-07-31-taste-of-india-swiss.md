Although trip to Switzerland is over but yet we can’t stop writing about
it. If you are one of those few regular visitors to our blog you must be
knowing by now how much we liked our one week stay. And must be
wondering what more can be there to write about.

  
Yes, there are always lot to write about Switzerland when we are
comparing with Paris and when one is seeing through Indian eyes. Where
all the pavements of the side walk are made of granite stone, all routes
being **well-marked**, not only that you can always be sure to find
**toilet paper** in any remote restroom and moreover **clean** restroom.
Last but not least even public telephones are equipped with electronic
phone book which can be hardly seen in **Paris**.

to the point what made me write this post is **‘Lassi’**. Yes, you heard
it right. You must be wondering whatz there to say about Lassi and
especially it might be nothing for Indians staying at UK. But to our
outmost surprise we noticed this product on the shelf in one of the
small ‘all-in-one’ store in Swiss-railway station. Later, we found the
same product in big store even which can be hardly seen in Paris rather
I should say can’t be seen at all.

  

  
According to old tradition, [lassi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lassi)
is served at the end of the main meal or taken at lunch time because
that's when appetite and digestion are at their peak. Lassi is meant to
help digestion and to be served at room temperature, not chilled but as
cold beverage usually taken in summer season.

So, at the sight of lassi that too with Indian flavor we were so
thrilled that almost every day we had it during our stay at Switzerland.
