Another nice weekend in the month of March and we are trying to see all
the top sights on our guidebook. We must admit this book is indeed a
very good and very nice gift from Akiko and others. A highly recommended
guidebook on Paris by **Avant Guide**.This time we started with St.
Chappell at Heart of Paris. Wonderful craftsmanship on glass windows,
which tells the story of Bible. Next to it is high court of France.On
the way back to hotel we got down at **Champs-Elysses Etoile**. After
walking on that famous road we decided to climb all those 200+ circular
steps to go to the top of the **<span
style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Arc de Triomphe</span>**. It was
worth going at top of the arch to have a clear view of 12 roads
connecting at that point. We spent a good time finding all other major
points which we could figure out from our limited knowledge of
Paris.With the dawn,as soon as the lights were lighted on Eiffel Tower
it was really looking magnifique.
