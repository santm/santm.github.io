It was a long time I played with new technology and changed any the way
the this blog looks to you. Liked few themes and [tried to put them in
my own taste](http://blog.santm.com/?theme=EG) before I found the
current one. But some how those themes really did not looks so cool to
and attractive to me at the end. So I went with the current one and did
not did not did much changes.

I was looking for a widget on on the sidebar for photo stream (the most
used on the net is the [flickr
one)](http://www.flickr.com/badge.gne "Flickr Badge "). I am not very
happy with their account policy so do have a a pro account.  as i was
looking around I found that the coolest solution for my need. I used
[Coolaris](http://www.cooliris.com/) with [Media
RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_RSS) to stream photo on the
sidebar.   Gallery2 does not come with Media RSS by default but as I am
running [Gallery3
Beta](http://blog.santm.com/2009/05/08/gallerry-3-sneak-peak) for a
while I am using the same. This means I  did changes  any major scripts
and got this cool widget.

At last I got [sifr](http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/sifr/) for
titles does not they looks right ?
