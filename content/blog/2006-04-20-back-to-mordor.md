Well it has been a long time I bloged. I am back to Paris; Pamela will
join me in a month time. The title of the post could not be better as I
am missing the sun after returning from India. I like rain after very
hot summer or sunny days with cool breeze. I really can not take those
dark cloudy days which makes me feel gloomy. As looking out of my window
can't even make out is it 11 AM or 3 PM. But if you still do not know
what I am talking about ask hobbits ;)

My vacation at India was great. I will try to post about few incidents
later. And hope not to forget them before my little brain gets clogged
with daily activities but at least I should write about changing face of
India where [guys are getting
pedicure](http://blog.santm.com/2006/03/15/changing-face-of-india-2/) in
a so called normal hair dressing saloon. That should be followed by
experience of flying with Air Deccan *low cost no frill* airlines, trip
to [Sikkim and Dooars (Forests of North
Bengal)](http://www.santm.com/gallery3/index.php/2006/dooars). There are
more but I think I should keep them a secret for while ....The end
should be flying from Doha to Paris.

Well, I just got back [my
PC](http://blog.santm.com/2006/03/06/my-pc/ "my PC") yesterday hope it
works for next 2 years without any trouble as I really do not have the
momentum to keep the big fight.Anywayz, I am happy that I am going to
meet some friends soon this weekend. One to be mentioned is I am going
to meet with Shubhankar after 11 years. Will keep posted...
