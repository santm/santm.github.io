Today sun and clouds chase each other across the skies along the shores
of Berlin as it glides past. We decided to visit Potsdam city situated
on southwest of Berlin known for Sanssouci (without worries) palace;
reached there by train.

As we were short of time having our return ticket to Paris same evening
we opted for sight-seeing guided tour bus available right outside the
train station. So along with other tourists we visited new palace, old
town hall, Fortunaportal and Nikolaikirche at Alter Markt, Schloss
Cecilienhof, Potsdam’s Brandenburg gate, Dutch colony, Russian colony
Alexandrowka providing flair of a city steeped in European tradition.
Last but not least Sanssouci palace where we left guided tour-bus as it
was last stop for them. We spent quite a time in Sanssouci garden –
terraced vineyard on southern side. From where we walked down to railway
station.

On returning we found even Berlin had a sunny day; without wasting time
we hoped again to bus no. 100 to take shots of historical sights with
blue sky. Then had late lunch and returned to hotel to collect luggage;
after bit of relaxing Santanu had beer at cheapest price (compared to
Paris) at home to country’s largest brewers.
