Being exhausted from last evening we got up bit late and had very good
breakfast before hitting the road. According to our itinerary, distance
to be covered was long one as our hotel was booked at **Florence**.

We took train to **La Spezia**, it was a crowded, got packed with each
passing stations of **Cinque Terre** but became empty as soon as we
crossed **Riomaggiore**. We had to wait a bit at La Spezia as train was
coming from north was late. We heard trains in Italy sometime get
delayed by few minutes to hours.

On our way to Florence we planned to visit the amazing 180 feet high
**Leaning Tower of Pisa** - stop for taking pictures as we were crunched
with time for visiting top sights.

  

At Pisa, we left our luggage at locker room of railway station went to
“Duomo” by local bus, which was a quick way to get a glimpse of this old
city. Pisa is also known for its famous university. As soon as we got
down from bus we found the entrance was packed with hawkers and souvenir
shops. It is a pretty common site in Italy to find people from North
African countries trying to lure tourist with fake designer bags to
sunglass.

After years of restoration leaning tower of Pisa now allows visitors to
climb up 500 plus stairs to get a breath taking view and unique
experience. But there was a small catch – we were told to wait for next
five hours for our turn to come. With exhausted legs from yesterday’s
hiking and dampened by the long queue we dropped the idea.

  

In the same campus there are three other key buildings which was also
build around the same time. The bell tower only looks leaning once it is
referenced against it surrounding. We started with the **cathedral
(duomo)** influenced by Byzantine architecture with magnificent red
tiles on the top.

After that we visited **Baptistery**- famous for its acoustics. And we
were very fortunate to witness the same. There was a group visiting the
same at the same time and one among them sang beautifully. Though we did
not understand any words what that gentleman was singing but we
experienced the power of music. It was a superb impromptu performance as
every one inside stopped and made sure there was pin drop silence.

From there we went **Camposanto** (cemetery) which are guarded together
by wall called as Field of Miracles. As we have nothing much to do we
tried plenty of pictures where we tried to give a push or hold the tower

  

Back at station we picked luggage and boarded train to Florence. The
view from the train was superb as we crossed the **Arno River** few
times. The lush green of wheat fields with mountains at backdrop were
very scenic with sun setting in west.

Arno river is very famous river as it flows through the famous Tuscany
region. To some Arno divides Italy in north and south as there is vast
political and socio-economical difference in those two parts.
