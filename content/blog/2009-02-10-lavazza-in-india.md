Just saw this advertisement on **BBC website** while checking my morning
dose of news. I was quite fascinated by this ad. Immediately started to
think **“Oh this is great!!”** now I can get a great coffee to start my
day at home by pressing a button.

If you are not familiar with this machine or not a coffee person this
machine uses special coffee capsules to dispense coffee. There are
varieties of flavor to choose from and trust me it really makes great
coffee.

In India tea is most preferred drink and most of people like to take it
with lots of milk. Similarly coffee drinkers also prefers latte instead
of “espresso” – sorry I am really addicted and spoiled and not quite
human at work unless I get my dark coffee.

Now coming to the ad, immediately I dialed the number as mentioned in
the advertisement and asked the tele-marketer about the price. And there
I got real shock – it cost **10,000 INR (aprrox. 200 USD)** for the
machine and **25 INR (50 cents US)** for the capsules. Now that is not a
price I can afford to start my day :(
