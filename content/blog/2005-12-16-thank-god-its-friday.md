It has been a while I wrote any post. Well, after quite a long time I
met with [Tapas](http://www.flickr.com/photos/26078084@N00/11217589086/)
a good old friend from Bay Area. The meeting was short while having
dinner at our place; got some updates on other friends in Bay Area.

  

Yesterday, was last French class before 2 week vacations so we went out
for drinks after the class. I never had this kind of social events where
you have to speak in French and you are not ashamed of your mistakes. It
was good as all others did not started conversing in English though the
french language was butchered like anything. It was fun; returned home
late night :( . Well, need to finish lots of homeworks and revise the
course now or chance of passing the exam is bleak

  

The big reason for writing today is about the comment I got - if I am
selling my [TIBX shoe
laces](http://blog.santm.com/2005/10/tibx-shoe-laces.html) or not? Well
the whole idea of writing that post came to me when I read the news of
Intel offering $10K for Dr.Mooreâ€™s paper published in Electronics
Magazine 40 years ago.
