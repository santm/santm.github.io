29th oct- We took spicejet flight to jaipur but unfortunatley couldnot
make it within time due to technical problems and traffic congestion we
were made to wait for 3 hrs inside flight.We reached around 10.00pm to
our prebooked hotel by prepaid taxi.On reaching hotel driver says "kya
bekar hotel liya hain sir"....ughh lump in my throat as all booking was
done by me. It was a laborious, monotonous job going through website
after website, jotting down details regarding price.With heavy heart
went in but found everything as per internet photos only.We asked for
next day car-hire for Shekhawati daytrip which they arranged.
