Finally went to Lalbagh flower show last weekend (8th Aug). Thanks to my
work; was awake from 3 AM and had no trouble of getting ready early on
Sunday. By 8:40 AM we reached; crowd just started to show-up there was
not much problem of parking and all. As soon after we entered the main
glass-house Aarush started to sneeze incessantly. Among many varieties
of flower main attraction was off course the huge structure of India
Gate made of roses; it was tribute to soldiers who lost their lives
during the Second World war. There were many orchids but my camera
failed to capture their beauty. We took a quick walk around because of
aarush and within another 60 minutes or so we were on our way back. Half
an hour later we realised that our li'l one is allergic to pollens
probably.
