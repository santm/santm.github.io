Ramkrishana Mission or center of Vendantic Society as we know it,
commonly is situated out side of Paris. A great place just to go and
spend some time in peace. It was birth anniversary of Ramkrishana when
we went there first time. We were very unsure how to reach the Center.
But it was a miracle we found some one speaking English at the station
to guide us. This center is quite big area-wise compared to San
Francisco and Berkeley one that we visited. If you are interested,
please check their web page for the
same.http://perso.wanadoo.fr/centre.vedantique/We met some nice families
of our mother tongue. They are living here for quite a long time, more
then 30+ years which was big shock to us. I am not yet in love with the
idea that I really want to live here for long or not. But it was nice to
know some people.
