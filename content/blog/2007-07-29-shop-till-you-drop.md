I took this picture last Sunday; when I tried to kill my boring rainy
afternoon with a cup of coffee at **Starbucks**. There is a big project
to make Singapore full with Hot-Spots; currently it is in BETA testing
mode and all you need to do is sign-up with Sing-Tel or StarHub or
M1(not sure) the three main Wireless provider ; the back-end services is
provided by iCell and Qmax networks.

As Singapore is famous for its shopping center. This picture I took to
capture shopping weariness of this guy as he drops on sofa at Starbucks
after shopping at [Mustafa Centre](http://www.mustafa.com.sg/). It is a
shopping paradise open for 24hrs. in Little-India area of Singapore
which is very famous among locals as well Indian tourists alike. They
even claim at weekend the store is packed with more then 15,000
customers of all nationalities. Well, while his lady partner was quite
busy on her mobile phone, it allowed me to take this picture (*invasion
of sleep if not privacy*). Personally, I do always complain about my
feet hurting and headache whenever I am in a **shopping mall** but never
dropped yet this way.
