Friday again, I am already at work for last nine hours(reached around
8ish). Wow! that's lot and time to head towards home soon.

Today, after lots of failure attempt I some how succeeded to capture a
very **cute visitor** at my window. I have no idea what kind of bird is
this, going to ask one expert for the same. Well, Pamela is working very
hard to upload pictures from Goa and writing trip details â€“ hope this
weekend we upload them.
