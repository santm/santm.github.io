Yes I am going to take vacations! It has been a while (after May 2005)
when we went out from our current address in Paris. In our standard of
travelling it is a record for good or bad...that can't be said. May be
it is the effect of **Chateau, Bateau, Gateau.**We would love to visit
some country-side or mountains now. But, unfortunately Pamela is not at
all interested for any ski-trip as she is complaining about the Paris
cold all the time. So no trip in Europe for now.

Well, this vacation I am cheering but may be it will be just like
another trip to India where my days are more hectic with relatives and
long journeys and at the end I question myself was it a vacation or my
social duties.

For sure I am going to travel a lot as I will start my trip of India
with Delhi and ending the same in Bombay. In between I am going to stop
at Siliguri, Calcutta & Durg for sure. I am adding this map with
pointers to give an idea.
