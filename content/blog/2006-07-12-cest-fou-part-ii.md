Finally, world cup football came to an end where France lost to Italy.
For me France lost but at same time Italy neither win as they just
waited for the final penalty shoot out to happen. I do not like the way
Italian play football in general. They make it dull and boring. Italian
and their relation to non Italian footballer are well known. And this
time the whole nation is waiting for the verdict of match fixing in
Italian league. Well there must be google of blogs and news on the same
but I could not stop making my post. This post is not about what
happened in the last 10 minutes of the final match.

FIFA at least should change the rules and make it like tennis when there
will be at least 2 goals difference for penalty shoot out; as just one
goal difference makes it similar to toss a coin to find the winner.

Well being in Paris it makes it special when France is playing the
final. France is a team which had great difficulties in qualifying for
the world cup with a draw against Israel but at the end they entered
group ‘G’ as top and found Switzerland again in the same group like the
qualifier. In the first 2 matches of the world cup they did not played
any thing great that one can expect them to be in Final. But in the
knock out stage they really played well and they deserve their well
earned place in the final.

 

A big credit goes to Zidane, and once again he reached the status of a
God in France. But the way it ended will remain controversial for years
to come. May be like that of 1986 Quarter Final between Argentina and
England. Where every one talks about the first goal of Maradona which
was a clear hand ball and he should have seen a red-card for that but no
one talks about the very next goal where he beat 6 English player before
scoring one of the beautiful goal of all time to my memory.

 

Yes, it was a good match but the face of French man on Monday after the
final was so pathetic that looked like they lost every thing to a
natural disaster or something. In France, I am sure this incident is
going to be in the media for a long time unless they win world cup soon
and forget all about.
