**  
Prologue:**  

Weeklong journey of
[Italy](http://blog.santm.com/2004/06/05/italy-revisited/) takes us back
to summer of 2004; due to various reasons never posted travelogues on
time though pictures from the same were published on time. Please hang
on as we try to recite detailed vacation from our faithful memory.

We had a night train from Bercy Station, Paris. For us, reaching Bercy
was bit far from our Metro Station (Exelmans on M9) as there was no easy
interchange; while on street-road map it looks closer from our
apartment. This train is not a fast train (TGV) but fast enough to take
you to Venice from Paris in one night. We started around 20:30 but due
to summer it was still very bright day when we left Paris. We travelled
by first class; the cabin was similar to AC 1st class compartment of
Indian trains in size. No doubt, the spotless and punctual services are
incomparable. Only down side of this night train is missing the beauty
of Alps as we cross in the night.

**  
Journey Begins:**  

After checking in pre-booked hotel at business centre of Italy,
**Milan** and having our breakfast we left for **Sforza Castle**,
rebuilt brick fortress and **Parco Sempione**. There is also “**Arco
della Pace**” resembling Arc-de-Triumph of Paris to hail Napoleon’s
entry into Milan. These are in the northern part of Milan and worth
visiting.

Santanu had heard a lot about **Lake Como** from his old colleague
*Antonio* about his home town. Those countless description aroused a
curiosity to visit Lake Como. Como and other lakes of Northern Italy are
very famous as they border with southern part of Switzerland. They are
the tourist destination to relax in tranquillity for rich and famous.
Rich bankers, fashion designers or Hollywood movie stars all want to
grab a lake side property here. In old time, these lakes also meant
reliable mode of transport to higher Alps from southern end.

Just half an hour from noisy, bustling Milan, Lake Como is a magical
combination of lush Mediterranean foliage and snowy alpine peaks. We
took a classic lakeside promenade, where roads are narrow, bit
congested, and lined by old villas (some of which even converted into
hotels) and from here we took a ferry ride to **Bellagio** on the
southern shore known as the pearl of the lake.

Ferry ride is very enchanting leading to other small villages along
lakeside which are hop away. Bellagio has narrow cobbled streets,
breathtaking views, impeccable small homes and glorious villas with
winding alleys, flowering balconies and lace-curtained windows which
give a feeling of most captivating spot.

> **Tips:** Instead of walking you can take a cab or bus from the train
> station to the lake front if your legs feel weak.

In recent time, two big ticket movies which I saw were shooted here -
“STAR WAR –II” and “Ocean Twelve.”

Although, village is not animated by tourists but still we repented to
leave this place as we had already booked hotel at Milan. Train journey
from Milan to Como was nice but lost in our memory to the natural beauty
of the lake and that magical afternoon on ferry. On returning had dinner
at one of the restaurant near Galleria Vittorio Emanuele which was
scrumptious.

> **Tips**: As summer days are long, afternoon ferry ride is a better
> option that way you can use the first part for exploring something
> else. You may enjoy the afternoon sun on the ferry for a sun-tan. But
> too late in the afternoon means you might not be able to get an
> *“aller-retour”* ferry ride.
