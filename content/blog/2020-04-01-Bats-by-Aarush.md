#### 2020 February 15th @ Calcutta ####

Not your cricket bat nor your baseball bat  
but just your friendly animal bat.  
Better known as the carrier of disease & death  
but is he the black savior of the human kind.  
  
Think again what it can do friend.  
Ravages real vampires to the end  
mosquitoes everyone till they are in grave.  
Killing pestering pests & insects.  
Saves 3.5 billion dollars because it does the same thing as the pesticide.  
  
Pollinator of flowers which bloom in colour   
to become delicious fruits.  
The real hero he should become true savior.  
But what stops him is a germ   
making him a killer of men  
why do so Mr. Germ ?  
Please give a good reason ?
